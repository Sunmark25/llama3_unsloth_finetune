00:12 My name is Tom,
00:14 and I've come here today to come clean
00:17 about what I do for money.
00:21 Basically, I use my mouth in strange ways
00:24 in exchange for cash.
00:27 I usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars
00:31 and on street corners,
00:32 so this mightn't be the most appropriate setting,
00:35 but I'd like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration
00:39 about what I do.
00:46 (Beatboxing)
02:14 And now, for my next number,
02:18 I'd like to return to the classics.
02:24 We're going to take it back,
02:27 way back,
02:29 back into time.
02:34 (Beatboxing: "Billie Jean")
02:54 ♫ Billie Jean is not my lover ♫
02:58 ♫ She's just a girl who claims that I am the one ♫
03:03 ♫ But the kid is not my son ♫
03:14 Wassup.
03:16 Thank you very much, TEDx.
03:19 If you guys haven't figured it out already,
03:22 my name's Tom Thum, and I'm a beatboxer,
03:24 which means all the sounds that you just heard
03:26 were made entirely using just my voice,
03:29 and the only thing was my voice.
03:31 And I can assure you
03:33 there are absolutely no effects
03:38 on this microphone whatsoever.
03:43 And I'm very, very stoked —
03:47 You guys are just applauding for everything. It's great.
03:50 Look at this, Mom! I made it!
03:55 I'm very, very stoked to be here today,
03:58 representing my kinfolk
03:60 and all those that haven't managed to make a career
04:03 out of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking.
04:07 Because it is a bit of a niche market,
04:10 and there's not much work going on,
04:12 especially where I'm from.
04:14 You know, I'm from Brisbane,
04:15 which is a great city to live in.
04:17 Yeah! All right! Most of Brisbane's here. That's good.
04:21 You know, I'm from Brizzy,
04:23 which is a great city to live in,
04:25 but let's be honest --
04:26 it's not exactly the cultural hub of the Southern Hemisphere.
04:30 So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane
04:34 and outside Australia,
04:35 and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine
04:38 has enabled me to see
04:40 so many amazing places in the world.
04:42 So I'd like to share with you, if I may, my experiences.
04:48 So ladies and gentlemen,
04:50 I would like to take you on a journey
04:53 throughout the continents
04:54 and throughout sound itself.
04:58 We start our journey in the central deserts.
05:03 (Didgeridoo)
05:13 (Airplane)
05:16 India.
05:18 (Beatboxing)
05:32 (Sitar)
05:37 China.
05:39 (Guzheng)
05:52 (Beatboxing)
05:59 Germany.
06:01 (Beatboxing)
06:19 Party, party, yeah.
06:26 And before we reach our final destination,
06:29 ladies and gentlemen,
06:31 I would like to share with you some technology
06:33 that I brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane.
06:37 These things in front of me here are called Kaoss Pads,
06:41 and they allow me to do a whole lot of different things
06:44 with my voice.
06:46 For example, the one on the left here
06:48 allows me to add
06:51 a little bit of reverb to my sound,
06:54 which gives me that --
06:55 (Trumpet) --
07:01 flavor.
07:04 And the other ones here,
07:06 I can use them in unison
07:08 to mimic the effect of a drum machine
07:11 or something like that.
07:12 I can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back
07:15 just by hitting the pads here.
07:20 (Noises)
07:34 TEDx.
07:40 (Music)
08:02 I got way too much time on my hands.
08:06 And last but not least,
08:08 the one on my right here allows me to
08:11 loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop
08:14 my voice.
08:17 So with all that in mind, ladies and gentlemen,
08:20 I would like to take you on a journey
08:23 to a completely separate part of Earth
08:25 as I transform the Sydney Opera House
08:28 into a smoky downtown jazz bar.
08:32 All right boys, take it away.
08:36 (Music)
08:45 Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you
08:47 to a very special friend of mine,
08:49 one of the greatest double bassists I know.
08:51 Mr. Smokey Jefferson, let's take it for a walk. Come on, baby.
08:56 (Music)
09:39 All right, ladies and gentlemen,
09:40 I'd like to introduce you to the star of the show,
09:43 one of the greatest jazz legends of our time.
09:45 Music lovers and jazz lovers alike,
09:48 please give a warm hand of applause
09:50 for the one and only Mr. Peeping Tom. Take it away.
09:54 (Music)
11:14 Thank you. Thank you very much.
