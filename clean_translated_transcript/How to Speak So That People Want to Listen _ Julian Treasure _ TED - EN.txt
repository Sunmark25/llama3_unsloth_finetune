00:14 The human voice:
00:16 It's the instrument we all play.
00:19 It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably.
00:21 It's the only one that can start a war or say "I love you."
00:24 And yet many people have the experience
00:26 that when they speak, people don't listen to them.
00:28 And why is that?
00:29 How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?
00:33 What I'd like to suggest,
00:35 there are a number of habits that we need to move away from.
00:38 I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking.
00:41 I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list,
00:44 but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.
00:49 First, gossip.
00:52 Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.
00:55 Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well
00:57 the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.
01:02 Second, judging.
01:04 We know people who are like this in conversation,
01:06 and it's very hard to listen to somebody
01:08 if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time.
01:12 Third, negativity.
01:14 You can fall into this.
01:16 My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative,
01:19 and it's hard to listen.
01:20 I remember one day, I said to her, "It's October 1 today,"
01:23 and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"
01:27 It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.
01:31 And another form of negativity, complaining.
01:33 Well, this is the national art of the U.K.
01:38 It's our national sport.
01:39 We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything,
01:42 but actually, complaining is viral misery.
01:45 It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.
01:48 Excuses.
01:50 We've all met this guy.
01:51 Maybe we've all been this guy.
01:53 Some people have a blamethrower.
01:55 They just pass it on to everybody else
01:58 and don't take responsibility for their actions,
02:00 and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that.
02:03 Penultimate, the sixth of the seven,
02:05 embroidery, exaggeration.
02:08 It demeans our language, actually, sometimes.
02:11 For example, if I see something that really is awesome,
02:14 what do I call it?
02:18 And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying,
02:21 and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us.
02:24 And finally, dogmatism.
02:28 The confusion of facts with opinions.
02:31 When those two things get conflated,
02:33 you're listening into the wind.
02:35 You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true.
02:38 It's difficult to listen to that.
02:41 So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking.
02:44 These are things I think we need to avoid.
02:46 But is there a positive way to think about this?
02:49 Yes, there is.
02:50 I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations,
02:56 that we can stand on if we want our speech
02:58 to be powerful and to make change in the world.
03:02 Fortunately, these things spell a word.
03:05 The word is "hail," and it has a great definition as well.
03:08 I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky
03:10 and hits you on the head.
03:12 I'm talking about this definition,
03:13 to greet or acclaim enthusiastically,
03:15 which is how I think our words will be received
03:17 if we stand on these four things.
03:19 So what do they stand for?
03:20 See if you can guess.
03:22 The H, honesty, of course,
03:25 being true in what you say, being straight and clear.
03:28 The A is authenticity, just being yourself.
03:32 A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth,
03:36 which I think is a lovely way to put it.
03:37 The I is integrity, being your word,
03:40 actually doing what you say,
03:42 and being somebody people can trust.
03:44 And the L is love.
03:47 I don't mean romantic love,
03:49 but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons.
03:53 First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want.
03:56 I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning.
03:59 Perhaps that's not necessary.
04:02 Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing.
04:05 But also, if you're really wishing somebody well,
04:08 it's very hard to judge them at the same time.
04:11 I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.
04:15 So hail.
04:17 Also, now that's what you say,
04:19 and it's like the old song, it is what you say,
04:21 it's also the way that you say it.
04:23 You have an amazing toolbox.
04:24 This instrument is incredible,
04:26 and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened.
04:30 I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now
04:32 and just pull a few tools out
04:34 that you might like to take away and play with,
04:36 which will increase the power of your speaking.
04:38 Register, for example.
04:40 Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time,
04:44 but there's a register in between.
04:46 I'm not going to get very technical about this
04:48 for any of you who are voice coaches.
04:50 You can locate your voice, however.
04:52 So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference.
04:55 If I go down here in my throat,
04:56 which is where most of us speak from most of the time.
04:59 But if you want weight,
05:01 you need to go down here to the chest.
05:03 You hear the difference?
05:05 We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true,
05:09 because we associate depth with power
05:12 and with authority.
05:14 That's register.
05:16 Then we have timbre.
05:18 It's the way your voice feels.
05:19 Again, the research shows
05:21 that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm,
05:24 like hot chocolate.
05:27 Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world,
05:30 because you can train.
05:31 Go and get a voice coach.
05:33 And there are amazing things you can do
05:34 with breathing, with posture, and with exercises
05:37 to improve the timbre of your voice.
05:39 Then prosody. I love prosody.
05:41 This is the sing-song, the meta-language
05:43 that we use in order to impart meaning.
05:45 It's root one for meaning in conversation.
05:48 People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to
05:52 if they don't have any prosody at all.
05:55 That's where the word "monotonic" comes from,
05:58 or monotonous, monotone.
06:00 Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in,
06:04 where every sentence ends as if it were a question
06:06 when it's actually not a question, it's a statement?
06:11 And if you repeat that one,
06:13 it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody,
06:16 which I think is a shame,
06:18 so let's try and break that habit.
06:21 Pace.
06:22 I can get very excited by saying something really quickly,
06:25 or I can slow right down to emphasize,
06:29 and at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.
06:35 There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there?
06:39 We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.
06:42 It can be very powerful.
06:44 Of course, pitch often goes along with pace
06:46 to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch.
06:49 Where did you leave my keys?
06:50 (Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys?
06:52 So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.
06:56 And finally, volume.
06:58 (Loud) I can get really excited by using volume.
07:02 Sorry about that, if I startled anybody.
07:04 Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet.
07:09 Some people broadcast the whole time.
07:11 Try not to do that.
07:12 That's called sodcasting,
07:15 Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately.
07:20 Not nice.
07:21 Of course, where this all comes into play most of all
07:24 is when you've got something really important to do.
07:26 It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people.
07:30 It might be proposing marriage,
07:32 asking for a raise, a wedding speech.
07:35 Whatever it is, if it's really important,
07:37 you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox
07:40 and the engine that it's going to work on,
07:43 and no engine works well without being warmed up.
07:46 Warm up your voice.
07:47 Actually, let me show you how to do that.
07:50 Would you all like to stand up for a moment?
07:53 I'm going to show you
07:54 the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.
07:59 Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these.
08:02 First, arms up, deep breath in,
08:05 and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.
08:08 One more time.
08:09 Ahhhh, very good.
08:12 Now we're going to warm up our lips,
08:14 and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,
08:16 Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.
08:19 And now, brrrrrrrrrr,
08:23 just like when you were a kid.
08:24 Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive.
08:27 We're going to do the tongue next
08:29 with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
08:33 Beautiful. You're getting really good at this.
08:35 And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.
08:38 That's like champagne for the tongue.
08:40 Finally, and if I can only do one,
08:42 the pros call this the siren.
08:44 It's really good. It starts with "we" and goes to "aw."
08:47 The "we" is high, the "aw" is low.
08:49 So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.
08:55 Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause.
08:57 Take a seat, thank you.
08:60 Next time you speak, do those in advance.
09:02 Now let me just put this in context to close.
09:05 This is a serious point here.
09:07 This is where we are now, right?
09:09 We speak not very well
09:11 to people who simply aren't listening
09:13 in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics.
09:16 I have talked about that on this stage in different phases.
09:19 What would the world be like
09:20 if we were speaking powerfully
09:22 to people who were listening consciously
09:24 in environments which were actually fit for purpose?
09:28 Or to make that a bit larger,
09:31 what would the world be like
09:32 if we were creating sound consciously
09:34 and consuming sound consciously
09:36 and designing all our environments
09:38 consciously for sound?
09:40 That would be a world that does sound beautiful,
09:43 and one where understanding would be the norm,
09:47 and that is an idea worth spreading.
09:49 Thank you.
