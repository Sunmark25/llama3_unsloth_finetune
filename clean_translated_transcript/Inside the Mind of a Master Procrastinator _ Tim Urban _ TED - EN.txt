00:13 So in college,
00:15 I was a government major,
00:17 which means I had to write a lot of papers.
00:19 Now, when a normal student writes a paper,
00:21 they might spread the work out a little like this.
00:24 So, you know --
00:27 you get started maybe a little slowly,
00:29 but you get enough done in the first week
00:31 that, with some heavier days later on,
00:32 everything gets done, things stay civil.
00:36 And I would want to do that like that.
00:38 That would be the plan.
00:39 I would have it all ready to go,
00:42 but then, actually, the paper would come along,
00:44 and then I would kind of do this.
00:49 And that would happen every single paper.
00:52 But then came my 90-page senior thesis,
00:56 a paper you're supposed to spend a year on.
00:58 And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option.
01:01 It was way too big a project.
01:03 So I planned things out,
01:04 and I decided I kind of had to go something like this.
01:08 This is how the year would go.
01:09 So I'd start off light,
01:11 and I'd bump it up in the middle months,
01:14 and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear
01:16 just like a little staircase.
01:18 How hard could it be to walk up the stairs?
01:20 No big deal, right?
01:23 But then, the funniest thing happened.
01:25 Those first few months?
01:27 They came and went,
01:28 and I couldn't quite do stuff.
01:30 So we had an awesome new revised plan.
01:33 And then --
01:36 But then those middle months actually went by,
01:39 and I didn't really write words,
01:41 and so we were here.
01:44 And then two months turned into one month,
01:46 which turned into two weeks.
01:48 And one day I woke up
01:50 with three days until the deadline,
01:54 still not having written a word,
01:55 and so I did the only thing I could:
01:58 I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,
02:00 pulling not one but two all-nighters --
02:02 humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters --
02:06 sprinted across campus,
02:08 dove in slow motion,
02:10 and got it in just at the deadline.
02:12 I thought that was the end of everything.
02:14 But a week later I get a call,
02:16 and it's the school.
02:18 And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"
02:19 And I say, "Yeah."
02:21 And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis."
02:23 And I say, "OK."
02:25 And they say,
02:27 "It's the best one we've ever seen."
02:37 That did not happen.
02:40 It was a very, very bad thesis.
02:45 I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought,
02:50 "This guy is amazing!"
02:53 No, no, it was very, very bad.
02:55 Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.
02:59 I write the blog Wait But Why.
03:01 And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
03:04 My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me,
03:08 and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world
03:11 what goes on in the heads of procrastinators,
03:13 and why we are the way we are.
03:15 Now, I had a hypothesis
03:16 that the brains of procrastinators were actually different
03:19 than the brains of other people.
03:22 And to test this, I found an MRI lab
03:24 that actually let me scan both my brain
03:26 and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator,
03:29 so I could compare them.
03:31 I actually brought them here to show you today.
03:33 I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.
03:36 I know that if you're not a trained brain expert,
03:39 it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?
03:41 So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
03:46 Now ...
03:48 here's my brain.
03:56 There is a difference.
03:58 Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them,
04:00 but the procrastinator's brain
04:02 also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
04:05 Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?
04:07 Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.
04:12 So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision
04:15 to do something productive,
04:17 but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,
04:19 so he actually takes the wheel,
04:21 and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page
04:24 of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal,
04:26 because I just remembered that that happened.
04:29 Then --
04:32 Then we're going to go over to the fridge,
04:34 to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.
04:37 After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral
04:39 that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets
04:42 and ends much, much later with us watching interviews
04:45 with Justin Bieber's mom.
04:49 "All of that's going to take a while,
04:51 so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today.
04:55 Sorry!"
04:56 (Sigh)
04:58 Now, what is going on here?
05:03 The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy
05:06 you want behind the wheel.
05:07 He lives entirely in the present moment.
05:09 He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future,
05:12 and he only cares about two things:
05:14 easy and fun.
05:16 Now, in the animal world, that works fine.
05:19 If you're a dog
05:21 and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things,
05:24 you're a huge success!
05:27 And to the Monkey,
05:30 humans are just another animal species.
05:32 You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation,
05:37 which in tribal times might have worked OK.
05:39 But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.
05:42 We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.
05:46 Which is why we have another guy in our brain,
05:48 the Rational Decision-Maker,
05:51 who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.
05:54 We can visualize the future.
05:56 We can see the big picture.
05:57 We can make long-term plans.
05:59 And he wants to take all of that into account.
06:02 And he wants to just have us do
06:04 whatever makes sense to be doing right now.
06:07 Now, sometimes it makes sense
06:08 to be doing things that are easy and fun,
06:10 like when you're having dinner or going to bed
06:12 or enjoying well-earned leisure time.
06:14 That's why there's an overlap.
06:16 Sometimes they agree.
06:18 But other times, it makes much more sense
06:20 to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant,
06:24 for the sake of the big picture.
06:26 And that's when we have a conflict.
06:28 And for the procrastinator,
06:29 that conflict tends to end a certain way every time,
06:32 leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone,
06:36 an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.
06:40 I call it the Dark Playground.
06:44 Now, the Dark Playground is a place
06:47 that all of you procrastinators out there know very well.
06:51 It's where leisure activities happen
06:53 at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.
06:56 The fun you have in the Dark Playground
06:58 isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned,
07:01 and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred --
07:04 all of those good procrastinator feelings.
07:07 And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel,
07:10 how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone,
07:14 a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?
07:17 Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel,
07:22 someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him
07:25 in his darkest moments --
07:27 someone called the Panic Monster.
07:34 Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time,
07:39 but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close
07:43 or there's danger of public embarrassment,
07:45 a career disaster or some other scary consequence.
07:48 And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of.
07:52 Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently,
07:57 because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago
07:60 and invited me to do a TED Talk.
08:07 Now, of course, I said yes.
08:09 It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.
08:24 But in the middle of all this excitement,
08:26 the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.
08:30 He was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted?
08:32 Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?
08:35 We need to sit down and work on this right now."
08:38 And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth
08:41 and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground,
08:44 and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country,
08:48 so we can get a better feel for India."
08:55 So that's what we did that day.
09:01 As six months turned into four and then two and then one,
09:05 the people of TED decided to release the speakers.
09:08 And I opened up the website, and there was my face
09:10 staring right back at me.
09:12 And guess who woke up?
09:17 So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind,
09:20 and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.
09:28 And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster --
09:31 boom, he's up the tree!
09:32 And finally,
09:33 finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel
09:36 and I can start working on the talk.
09:37 Now, the Panic Monster explains
09:40 all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior,
09:43 like how someone like me could spend two weeks
09:46 unable to start the opening sentence of a paper,
09:49 and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic
09:52 to stay up all night and write eight pages.
09:56 And this entire situation, with the three characters --
09:59 this is the procrastinator's system.
10:02 It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
10:06 This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.
10:10 When I did, I was amazed by the response.
10:13 Literally thousands of emails came in,
10:15 from all different kinds of people from all over the world,
10:18 doing all different kinds of things.
10:19 These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers
10:22 and lots and lots of PhD students.
10:27 And they were all writing, saying the same thing:
10:29 "I have this problem too."
10:31 But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post
10:35 and the heaviness of these emails.
10:37 These people were writing with intense frustration
10:40 about what procrastination had done to their lives,
10:43 about what this Monkey had done to them.
10:47 And I thought about this, and I said,
10:50 well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?
10:53 Why are all of these people in such a dark place?
10:56 Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.
10:60 Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given,
11:03 they all have deadlines.
11:04 And when there's deadlines,
11:05 the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term
11:08 because the Panic Monster gets involved.
11:10 But there's a second kind of procrastination
11:12 that happens in situations when there is no deadline.
11:15 So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter --
11:18 something in the arts, something entrepreneurial --
11:20 there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening,
11:24 not until you've gone out and done the hard work
11:26 to get momentum, get things going.
11:27 There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career
11:31 that don't involve any deadlines,
11:32 like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health,
11:35 working on your relationship
11:37 or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.
11:40 Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things
11:45 is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,
11:47 because in all of these non-deadline situations,
11:49 the Panic Monster doesn't show up.
11:51 He has nothing to wake up for,
11:53 so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained;
11:55 they just extend outward forever.
11:58 And it's this long-term kind of procrastination
12:01 that's much less visible and much less talked about
12:04 than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind.
12:07 It's usually suffered quietly and privately.
12:11 And it can be the source
12:12 of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.
12:17 And I thought, that's why those people are emailing,
12:19 and that's why they're in such a bad place.
12:22 It's not that they're cramming for some project.
12:25 It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator,
12:28 at times, in their own lives.
12:31 The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams;
12:34 it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.
12:37 So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany --
12:42 that I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
12:46 That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators.
12:50 Now, you might not all be a mess,
12:52 like some of us,
12:55 and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines,
12:58 but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick
13:01 is when the deadlines aren't there.
13:03 Now, I want to show you one last thing.
13:05 I call this a Life Calendar.
13:08 That's one box for every week of a 90-year life.
13:13 That's not that many boxes,
13:15 especially since we've already used a bunch of those.
13:19 So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.
13:25 We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on,
13:28 because everyone is procrastinating on something in life.
13:33 We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
13:37 That's a job for all of us.
13:41 And because there's not that many boxes on there,
13:43 it's a job that should probably start today.
13:45 Well, maybe not today, but ...
13:50 You know.
13:52 Sometime soon.
13:53 Thank you.
