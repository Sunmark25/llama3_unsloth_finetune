00:13 Do you think it's possible to control someone's attention?
00:18 Even more than that, what about predicting human behavior?
00:22 I think those are interesting ideas.
00:24 For me, that would be the perfect superpower,
00:26 actually kind of an evil way of approaching it.
00:29 But for myself, in the past, I've spent the last 20 years
00:32 studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way:
00:35 picking pockets.
00:37 When we think of misdirection,
00:39 we think of something as looking off to the side,
00:41 when actually the things right in front of us
00:43 are often the hardest to see,
00:45 the things that you look at every day that you're blinded to.
00:48 For example, how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now?
00:53 Great. Double-check.
00:54 Make sure you still have them.
00:55 I was doing some shopping before.
00:58 You've looked at them a few times today,
01:00 but I'll ask you a question.
01:02 Without looking at it directly yet,
01:03 can you remember the icon in the bottom right corner?
01:08 Bring them out, check and see how accurate you were.
01:14 How'd you do?
01:16 Show of hands. Did we get it?
01:18 Now that you're done, close them down.
01:20 Every phone has something in common.
01:22 No matter how you organize the icons,
01:24 you still have a clock on the front.
01:26 So, without looking at your phone, what time was it?
01:30 You just looked at your clock, right?
01:32 Interesting idea.
01:33 Let's take that a step further with a game of trust.
01:35 Close your eyes.
01:37 I realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard
01:40 there's a pickpocket in the room, but close your eyes.
01:43 Now, you've been watching me for about 30 seconds.
01:46 With your eyes closed, what am I wearing?
01:50 Make your best guess.
01:51 What color is my shirt? What color is my tie?
01:55 Now open your eyes.
01:56 Show of hands, were you right?
01:59 Interesting, isn't it?
01:60 Some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others, it seems.
02:03 But I have a different theory about that model of attention.
02:06 They have fancy models of attention, Posner's trinity model of attention.
02:10 For me, I like to think of it very simple, like a surveillance system.
02:13 It's kind of like you have all these fancy sensors,
02:16 and inside your brain is a little security guard.
02:18 For me, I like to call him Frank.
02:21 So Frank is sitting at a desk.
02:23 He's got lots of cool information in front of him,
02:25 high-tech equipment, he's got cameras,
02:27 he's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears,
02:30 all these senses, all these perceptions.
02:32 But attention is what steers your perceptions,
02:35 it's what controls your reality.
02:37 It's the gateway to the mind.
02:39 If you don't attend to something, you can't be aware of it.
02:41 But ironically, you can attend to something without being aware of it.
02:45 For example, the cocktail effect:
02:47 You're in a party, having conversations with someone,
02:49 and yet you can recognize your name
02:51 without realizing you were listening to that.
02:53 Now, for my job, I have to play with techniques to exploit this,
02:56 to play with your attention as a limited resource.
02:59 So if I could control how you spend your attention,
03:02 if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction.
03:05 Now, instead of doing it like misdirection
03:08 and throwing it off to the side,
03:09 instead, what I choose to focus on is Frank,
03:12 to be able to play with the Frank inside your head,
03:14 your security guard,
03:16 and get you, instead of focusing on your external senses,
03:18 just to go internal for a second.
03:21 So if I ask you to access a memory, like, what is that?
03:25 What just happened? Do you have a wallet?
03:27 Do you have an American Express in your wallet?
03:29 And when I do that, your Frank turns around.
03:32 He accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape.
03:34 What's interesting is, he can't rewind the tape
03:36 at the same time that he's trying to process new data.
03:39 This sounds like a good theory,
03:41 but I could talk for a long time, tell you lots of things,
03:44 and a portion of them may be true,
03:45 but I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live.
03:48 If I come down, I'm going to do a bit of shopping.
03:51 Just hold still where you are.
03:56 Hello, how are you? It's lovely to see you.
03:58 Wonderful job onstage.
03:59 Lovely watch, it doesn't come off very well.
04:01 Do you have a ring as well?
04:03 Good. Just taking inventory. You're like a buffet.
04:05 Hard to tell where to start, so many great things.
04:08 Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
04:09 Hi, sir, could you stand up, please? Just right where you are.
04:12 You're married, you follow directions well.
04:14 Nice to meet you, sir.
04:16 You don't have a lot in your pockets. Anything down here?
04:19 Hopefully so. Have a seat. There you go. You're doing well.
04:22 Hi, sir, how are you?
04:24 Good to see you, sir. You have a ring, a watch.
04:26 Do you have a wallet on you? Joe: I don't.
04:28 AR: Well, we'll find one for you. Come on up this way, Joe.
04:38 AR: Pardon me.
04:41 I don't think I need this clicker anymore.
04:43 Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
04:45 Come on up to the stage, Joe. Let's play a little game now.
04:47 Anything in your front pockets?
04:49 J: Money.
04:50 AR: Money! All right, let's try that.
04:53 Can you stand right over this way for me?
04:55 Turn around and, let's see,
04:57 if I give you something that belongs to me,
04:59 this is just something I have,
05:01 a poker chip.
05:02 Hold out your hand for me.
05:04 Watch it closely.
05:05 This is a task for you to focus on.
05:07 You have your money in your front pocket?
05:10 J: Yup. AR: Good.
05:11 I won't put my hand in your pocket. I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.
05:14 Once a guy had a hole in his pocket,
05:16 and that was rather traumatizing for me.
05:18 I wanted his wallet, he gave me his number.
05:20 Big miscommunication.
05:22 Let's do this simply. Squeeze your hand tight.
05:25 Do you feel the poker chip in your hand?
05:27 J: I do.
05:28 AR: Would you be surprised if I took it? Say yes.
05:30 J: Very. AR: Good.
05:31 Open your hand. Thank you very much.
05:33 I'll cheat if you give me a chance.
05:35 Make it harder for me. Just use your hand.
05:37 Grab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.
05:39 Did you see it go? Joe: No.
05:41 AR: No, it's not here. Open your hand.
05:43 While we're focused on the hand, it's sitting on your shoulder.
05:47 Go ahead and take it off.
05:49 Now, let's try that again.
05:50 Hold your hand out flat. Open it up.
05:52 Put your hand up a little bit higher, but watch it close.
05:55 If I did it slowly, it'd be on your shoulder.
05:59 Joe, we're going to keep doing this till you catch it.
06:02 You'll get it eventually. I have faith in you.
06:04 Squeeze firm. You're human, you're not slow.
06:06 It's back on your shoulder.
06:08 You were focused on your hand, distracted.
06:10 While you were watching, I couldn't get your watch off.
06:13 Yet you had something inside your pocket.
06:16 Do you remember what it was?
06:17 J: Money.
06:19 AR: Check your pocket. Is it still there?
06:22 Oh, there it was. Put it away.
06:24 We're just shopping.
06:25 This trick's more about the timing.
06:27 I'm going to try to push it inside your hand.
06:29 Put your other hand on top, would you?
06:31 It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?
06:33 Looks a lot like the watch I was wearing, doesn't it?
06:37 J: That's pretty good. AR: Oh, thanks.
06:41 But it's only a start. Let's try it a little bit differently.
06:44 Hold your hands together. Your other hand on top.
06:47 If you're watching this little token,
06:48 this obviously has become a little target, like a red herring.
06:51 If we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away.
06:54 It's not back on your shoulder.
06:56 It falls out of the air, lands right back in the hand.
06:58 Did you see it go?
07:00 Yeah, funny. We've got a little guy. He's union, works up there all day.
07:04 If I do it slowly it goes straight away, it lands by your pocket.
07:07 Is it in this pocket, sir?
07:08 Don't reach in your pocket. That's a different show.
07:11 (Squeaking)
07:12 That's rather strange. They have shots for that.
07:14 Can I show them? Rather bizarre. Is this yours, sir?
07:17 I have no idea how that works. We'll send that over there.
07:20 I need help with this one.
07:21 Step over this way for me.
07:22 Don't run away. You had something down by your pants pocket.
07:25 I was checking mine. I couldn't find everything,
07:28 but I noticed you had something here.
07:29 Can I feel the outside for a moment?
07:31 Down here I noticed this. Is this something of yours, sir?
07:34 I have no idea. That's a shrimp.
07:36 J: Yeah. I'm saving it for later.
07:38 AR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way,
07:41 better than you know.
07:42 So we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift.
07:46 Hopefully it matches his taste.
07:48 We have a couple of other things,
07:50 a little bit of cash.
07:51 And we have a few other things,
07:53 these all belong to you,
07:58 Joe, thank you very much.
08:06 So, same question I asked you before,
08:09 but this time you don't have to close your eyes.
08:12 What am I wearing?
08:14 Audience: Oh!
08:23 Attention is a powerful thing.
08:25 Like I said, it shapes your reality.
08:28 So, I guess I'd like to pose that question to you.
08:30 If you could control somebody's attention,
08:32 what would you do with it?
08:35 Thank you.
