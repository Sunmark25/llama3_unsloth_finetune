00:15 Okay, now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room,
00:20 but it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar.
00:26 Also, the person to your left is a liar.
00:29 Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar.
00:32 We're all liars.
00:34 What I'm going to do today
00:36 is I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars,
00:40 how you can become a liespotter
00:41 and why you might want to go the extra mile
00:44 and go from liespotting to truth seeking,
00:47 and ultimately to trust building.
00:49 Now, speaking of trust,
00:52 ever since I wrote this book, "Liespotting,"
00:55 no one wants to meet me in person anymore, no, no, no, no, no.
00:58 They say, "It's okay, we'll email you."
01:03 I can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks.
01:07 My husband's like, "Honey, deception?
01:09 Maybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking?"
01:12 So before I get started, what I'm going to do
01:15 is I'm going to clarify my goal for you,
01:17 which is not to teach a game of Gotcha.
01:19 Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids,
01:21 those kids in the back of the room that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha!
01:25 Your eyebrow twitched. You flared your nostril.
01:27 I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.' I know you're lying."
01:30 No, liespotters are armed
01:32 with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception.
01:35 They use it to get to the truth,
01:37 and they do what mature leaders do everyday;
01:39 they have difficult conversations with difficult people,
01:42 sometimes during very difficult times.
01:44 And they start up that path by accepting a core proposition,
01:48 and that proposition is the following:
01:50 Lying is a cooperative act.
01:54 Think about it, a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance.
01:57 Its power emerges
01:59 when someone else agrees to believe the lie.
02:01 So I know it may sound like tough love,
02:03 but look, if at some point you got lied to,
02:07 it's because you agreed to get lied to.
02:09 Truth number one about lying: Lying's a cooperative act.
02:12 Now not all lies are harmful.
02:14 Sometimes we're willing participants in deception
02:17 for the sake of social dignity,
02:20 maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret, secret.
02:23 We say, "Nice song."
02:25 "Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."
02:28 Or we say, favorite of the digiratti,
02:30 "You know, I just fished that email out of my Spam folder.
02:33 So sorry."
02:36 But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception.
02:40 And that can have dramatic costs for us.
02:42 Last year saw 997 billion dollars
02:45 in corporate fraud alone in the United States.
02:50 That's an eyelash under a trillion dollars.
02:52 That's seven percent of revenues.
02:53 Deception can cost billions.
02:55 Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.
02:58 Or in the case of double agents and traitors,
03:01 like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames,
03:03 lies can betray our country,
03:05 they can compromise our security, they can undermine democracy,
03:08 they can cause the deaths of those that defend us.
03:11 Deception is actually serious business.
03:14 This con man, Henry Oberlander, he was such an effective con man,
03:18 British authorities say
03:20 he could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world.
03:24 And you can't find this guy on Google; you can't find him anywhere.
03:27 He was interviewed once, and he said the following.
03:29 He said, "Look, I've got one rule."
03:31 And this was Henry's rule, he said,
03:33 "Look, everyone is willing to give you something.
03:36 They're ready to give you something for whatever it is they're hungry for."
03:39 And that's the crux of it.
03:41 If you don't want to be deceived, you have to know,
03:43 what is it that you're hungry for?
03:45 And we all kind of hate to admit it.
03:47 We wish we were better husbands, better wives,
03:50 smarter, more powerful, taller, richer --
03:54 the list goes on.
03:56 Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap,
03:58 to connect our wishes and our fantasies
04:00 about who we wish we were, how we wish we could be,
04:03 with what we're really like.
04:06 And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies.
04:10 On a given day, studies show that you may be lied to
04:12 anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
04:14 Now granted, many of those are white lies.
04:17 But in another study,
04:19 it showed that strangers lied three times
04:21 within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
04:25 Now when we first hear this data, we recoil.
04:28 We can't believe how prevalent lying is.
04:30 We're essentially against lying.
04:32 But if you look more closely, the plot actually thickens.
04:36 We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers.
04:39 Extroverts lie more than introverts.
04:43 Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people.
04:48 Women lie more to protect other people.
04:51 If you're an average married couple,
04:54 you're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions.
04:58 Now, you may think that's bad.
05:00 If you're unmarried, that number drops to three.
05:03 Lying's complex.
05:04 It's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives.
05:07 We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
05:09 We parse it out on an as-needed basis,
05:11 sometimes for very good reasons,
05:13 other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives.
05:16 That's truth number two about lying.
05:18 We're against lying,
05:20 but we're covertly for it
05:22 in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries.
05:26 It's as old as breathing.
05:28 It's part of our culture, it's part of our history.
05:31 Think Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.
05:38 Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species.
05:41 Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species,
05:44 the larger the neocortex,
05:46 the more likely it is to be deceptive.
05:48 Now you might remember Koko.
05:50 Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language?
05:54 Koko was taught to communicate via sign language.
05:56 Here's Koko with her kitten.
05:58 It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.
06:01 Koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall.
06:07 We're hardwired to become leaders of the pack.
06:09 It's starts really, really early.
06:11 How early?
06:13 Well babies will fake a cry,
06:15 pause, wait to see who's coming
06:17 and then go right back to crying.
06:19 One-year-olds learn concealment.
06:23 Two-year-olds bluff.
06:25 Five-year-olds lie outright.
06:27 They manipulate via flattery.
06:29 Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up.
06:32 By the time you enter college,
06:34 you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions.
06:38 By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners,
06:41 we enter a world that is just cluttered with Spam, fake digital friends,
06:44 partisan media,
06:46 ingenious identity thieves,
06:48 world-class Ponzi schemers,
06:50 a deception epidemic --
06:52 in short, what one author calls a post-truth society.
06:57 It's been very confusing for a long time now.
07:04 What do you do?
07:05 Well, there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass.
07:09 Trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time.
07:12 The rest of us, we're only 54 percent accurate.
07:15 Why is it so easy to learn?
07:17 There are good liars and bad liars.
07:19 There are no real original liars.
07:21 We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques.
07:24 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you two patterns of deception.
07:28 And then we're going to look at the hot spots
07:30 and see if we can find them ourselves.
07:32 We're going to start with speech.
07:34 (Video) Bill Clinton: I want you to listen to me.
07:36 I'm going to say this again.
07:37 I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.
07:44 I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never.
07:48 And these allegations are false.
07:51 And I need to go back to work for the American people.
07:54 Thank you.
07:58 Pamela Meyer: Okay, what were the telltale signs?
08:01 Well first we heard what's known as a non-contracted denial.
08:05 Studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial
08:08 will resort to formal rather than informal language.
08:11 We also heard distancing language: "that woman."
08:14 We know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves
08:17 from their subject,
08:18 using language as their tool.
08:21 Now if Bill Clinton had said, "Well, to tell you the truth ..."
08:24 or Richard Nixon's favorite, "In all candor ..."
08:27 he would have been a dead giveaway
08:28 for any liespotter that knows
08:30 that qualifying language, as it's called, qualifying language like that,
08:34 further discredits the subject.
08:35 Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety,
08:38 or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail --
08:42 and we're all really glad he didn't do that --
08:44 he would have further discredited himself.
08:46 Freud had it right.
08:48 Freud said, look, there's much more to it than speech:
08:51 "No mortal can keep a secret.
08:54 If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips."
08:57 And we all do it no matter how powerful you are.
09:00 We all chatter with our fingertips.
09:02 I'm going to show you Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama
09:05 who's chattering with his fingertips.
09:11 Now this brings us to our next pattern, which is body language.
09:17 With body language, here's what you've got to do.
09:20 You've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door.
09:23 Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit.
09:26 Because we think liars fidget all the time.
09:28 Well guess what, they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying.
09:32 We think liars won't look you in the eyes.
09:34 Well guess what, they look you in the eyes a little too much
09:37 just to compensate for that myth.
09:39 We think warmth and smiles convey honesty, sincerity.
09:42 But a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away.
09:46 Can you all spot the fake smile here?
09:50 You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks.
09:55 But the real smile's in the eyes, the crow's feet of the eyes.
09:58 They cannot be consciously contracted,
10:00 especially if you overdid the Botox.
10:02 Don't overdo the Botox; nobody will think you're honest.
10:05 Now we're going to look at the hot spots.
10:07 Can you tell what's happening in a conversation?
10:10 Can you start to find the hot spots
10:12 to see the discrepancies
10:14 between someone's words and someone's actions?
10:16 Now, I know it seems really obvious,
10:18 but when you're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception,
10:23 attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators.
10:26 An honest person is going to be cooperative.
10:29 They're going to show they're on your side.
10:31 They're going to be enthusiastic.
10:32 They're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth.
10:36 They're going to be willing to brainstorm, name suspects,
10:38 provide details.
10:40 They're going to say,
10:41 "Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks."
10:44 They're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused
10:48 throughout the entire course of the interview, not just in flashes;
10:51 they'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview.
10:54 And if you ask someone honest
10:56 what should happen to whomever did forge those checks,
10:58 an honest person is much more likely
11:00 to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment.
11:03 Now let's say you're having that exact same conversation
11:06 with someone deceptive.
11:07 That person may be withdrawn,
11:09 look down, lower their voice,
11:11 pause, be kind of herky-jerky.
11:13 Ask a deceptive person to tell their story,
11:15 they're going to pepper it with way too much detail
11:18 in all kinds of irrelevant places.
11:21 And then they're going to tell their story in strict chronological order.
11:25 And what a trained interrogator does
11:27 is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours,
11:30 they will ask that person to tell that story backwards,
11:33 and then they'll watch them squirm,
11:35 and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells.
11:39 Why do they do that? Well, we all do the same thing.
11:41 We rehearse our words,
11:43 but we rarely rehearse our gestures.
11:45 We say "yes," we shake our heads "no."
11:47 We tell very convincing stories, we slightly shrug our shoulders.
11:50 We commit terrible crimes,
11:52 and we smile at the delight in getting away with it.
11:55 Now, that smile is known in the trade as "duping delight."
11:58 And we're going to see that in several videos moving forward,
12:01 but we're going to start -- for those of you who don't know him,
12:04 this is presidential candidate John Edwards
12:06 who shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock.
12:09 We're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test.
12:12 See now if you can spot him saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no,"
12:16 slightly shrugging his shoulders.
12:18 (Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy to participate in one.
12:21 I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine,
12:24 because of the timing of events.
12:25 So I know it's not possible.
12:27 Happy to take a paternity test, and would love to see it happen.
12:31 Interviewer: Are you going to do that soon? Is there somebody --
12:34 JE: Well, I'm only one side. I'm only one side of the test.
12:37 But I'm happy to participate in one.
12:41 PM: Okay, those head shakes are much easier to spot
12:44 once you know to look for them.
12:45 There are going to be times when someone makes one expression
12:49 while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash.
12:52 Murderers are known to leak sadness.
12:54 Your new joint venture partner might shake your hand,
12:57 celebrate, go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger.
13:01 And we're not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here,
13:05 but there's one I can teach you that's very dangerous
13:07 and it's easy to learn,
13:09 and that's the expression of contempt.
13:10 Now with anger, you've got two people on an even playing field.
13:13 It's still somewhat of a healthy relationship.
13:16 But when anger turns to contempt, you've been dismissed.
13:19 It's associated with moral superiority.
13:21 And for that reason, it's very, very hard to recover from.
13:24 Here's what it looks like.
13:26 It's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in.
13:30 It's the only asymmetrical expression.
13:33 And in the presence of contempt, whether or not deception follows --
13:37 and it doesn't always follow --
13:39 look the other way, go the other direction,
13:41 reconsider the deal,
13:43 say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you."
13:47 Science has surfaced many, many more indicators.
13:51 We know, for example,
13:53 we know liars will shift their blink rate,
13:55 point their feet towards an exit.
13:57 They will take barrier objects
13:59 and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them.
14:03 They'll alter their vocal tone,
14:04 often making their vocal tone much lower.
14:07 Now here's the deal.
14:09 These behaviors are just behaviors.
14:12 They're not proof of deception.
14:14 They're red flags.
14:16 We're human beings.
14:18 We make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long.
14:22 They don't mean anything in and of themselves.
14:24 But when you see clusters of them, that's your signal.
14:26 Look, listen, probe, ask some hard questions,
14:29 get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing,
14:32 walk into curiosity mode, ask more questions,
14:35 have a little dignity, treat the person you're talking to with rapport.
14:39 Don't try to be like those folks on "Law &amp; Order" and those other TV shows
14:42 that pummel their subjects into submission.
14:44 Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work.
14:47 Now, we've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who's lying
14:51 and how to spot a lie.
14:52 And as I promised, we're now going to look at what the truth looks like.
14:56 But I'm going to show you two videos,
14:58 two mothers -- one is lying, one is telling the truth.
15:00 And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California.
15:04 And I think they're an excellent example of what the truth looks like.
15:08 This mother, Diane Downs,
15:10 shot her kids at close range,
15:12 drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car,
15:16 claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.
15:18 And you'll see when you see the video,
15:20 she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother.
15:23 What you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy
15:26 between horrific events that she describes and her very, very cool demeanor.
15:30 And if you look closely, you'll see duping delight throughout this video.
15:34 (Video) Diane Downs: At night when I close my eyes,
15:36 I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving,
15:39 and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth.
15:42 And that -- maybe it'll fade too with time --
15:44 but I don't think so.
15:45 That bothers me the most.
15:55 PM: Now I'm going to show you a video
15:57 of an actual grieving mother, Erin Runnion,
15:59 confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court.
16:03 Here you're going to see no false emotion,
16:05 just the authentic expression of a mother's agony.
16:08 (Video) Erin Runnion: I wrote this statement
16:10 on the third anniversary of the night you took my baby,
16:13 and you hurt her,
16:14 and you crushed her,
16:16 you terrified her until her heart stopped.
16:20 And she fought, and I know she fought you.
16:23 But I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes,
16:27 and you still wanted to kill her.
16:30 And I don't understand it,
16:32 and I never will.
16:36 PM: Okay, there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions.
16:39 Now the technology around what the truth looks like
16:42 is progressing on, the science of it.
16:45 We know, for example,
16:47 that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans,
16:50 MRI's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out
16:53 when we're trying to be deceptive.
16:55 And these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us
16:58 as panaceas for deceit,
17:00 and they will prove incredibly useful some day.
17:03 But you've got to ask yourself in the meantime:
17:06 Who do you want on your side of the meeting,
17:08 someone who's trained in getting to the truth
17:10 or some guy who's going to drag a 400-pound electroencephalogram
17:13 through the door?
17:15 Liespotters rely on human tools.
17:18 They know, as someone once said,
17:20 "Character's who you are in the dark."
17:22 And what's kind of interesting is that today, we have so little darkness.
17:26 Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.
17:29 It's transparent with blogs and social networks
17:33 broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people
17:36 that have made a choice to live their lives in public.
17:39 It's a much more noisy world.
17:42 So one challenge we have is to remember,
17:46 oversharing, that's not honesty.
17:49 Our manic tweeting and texting can blind us
17:53 to the fact that the subtleties of human decency -- character integrity --
17:57 that's still what matters, that's always what's going to matter.
17:60 So in this much noisier world,
18:01 it might make sense for us
18:03 to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code.
18:08 When you combine the science of recognizing deception
18:11 with the art of looking, listening,
18:13 you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie.
18:15 You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit,
18:19 because you signal to everyone around you,
18:21 you say, "Hey, my world, our world, it's going to be an honest one.
18:26 My world is going to be one where truth is strengthened
18:29 and falsehood is recognized and marginalized."
18:31 And when you do that,
18:33 the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit.
18:36 And that's the truth. Thank you.
