00:13 What keeps us healthy and happy
00:16 as we go through life?
00:19 If you were going to invest now
00:21 in your future best self,
00:23 where would you put your time and your energy?
00:27 There was a recent survey of millennials
00:30 asking them what their most important life goals were,
00:35 and over 80 percent said
00:37 that a major life goal for them was to get rich.
00:41 And another 50 percent of those same young adults
00:45 said that another major life goal
00:48 was to become famous.
00:52 And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder
00:59 and achieve more.
01:01 We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after
01:05 in order to have a good life.
01:07 Pictures of entire lives,
01:09 of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,
01:14 those pictures are almost impossible to get.
01:18 Most of what we know about human life
01:21 we know from asking people to remember the past,
01:25 and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.
01:29 We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,
01:33 and sometimes memory is downright creative.
01:37 But what if we could watch entire lives
01:41 as they unfold through time?
01:44 What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
01:48 all the way into old age
01:51 to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
01:56 We did that.
01:58 The Harvard Study of Adult Development
01:60 may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
02:06 For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
02:13 year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
02:18 and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
02:22 were going to turn out.
02:25 Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
02:29 Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
02:33 because too many people drop out of the study,
02:36 or funding for the research dries up,
02:39 or the researchers get distracted,
02:41 or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
02:46 But through a combination of luck
02:49 and the persistence of several generations of researchers,
02:52 this study has survived.
02:55 About 60 of our original 724 men
02:59 are still alive,
03:00 still participating in the study,
03:03 most of them in their 90s.
03:06 And we are now beginning to study
03:08 the more than 2,000 children of these men.
03:12 And I'm the fourth director of the study.
03:15 Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
03:20 The first group started in the study
03:22 when they were sophomores at Harvard College.
03:25 They all finished college during World War II,
03:28 and then most went off to serve in the war.
03:31 And the second group that we've followed
03:33 was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
03:38 boys who were chosen for the study
03:40 specifically because they were from some of the most troubled
03:43 and disadvantaged families
03:45 in the Boston of the 1930s.
03:48 Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
03:55 When they entered the study,
03:56 all of these teenagers were interviewed.
03:59 They were given medical exams.
04:02 We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
04:05 And then these teenagers grew up into adults
04:08 who entered all walks of life.
04:10 They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
04:16 one President of the United States.
04:20 Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
04:25 Some climbed the social ladder
04:28 from the bottom all the way to the very top,
04:31 and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
04:36 The founders of this study
04:39 would never in their wildest dreams
04:41 have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
04:45 telling you that the study still continues.
04:49 Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
04:53 calls up our men and asks them if we can send them
04:56 yet one more set of questions about their lives.
05:00 Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
05:04 "Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting."
05:09 The Harvard men never ask that question.
05:21 To get the clearest picture of these lives,
05:24 we don't just send them questionnaires.
05:27 We interview them in their living rooms.
05:29 We get their medical records from their doctors.
05:32 We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
05:35 we talk to their children.
05:36 We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
05:42 And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
05:45 if they would join us as members of the study,
05:48 many of the women said, "You know, it's about time."
05:52 So what have we learned?
05:53 What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
05:58 of information that we've generated
06:02 on these lives?
06:04 Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
06:11 The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
06:17 Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
06:23 We've learned three big lessons about relationships.
06:27 The first is that social connections are really good for us,
06:31 and that loneliness kills.
06:34 It turns out that people who are more socially connected
06:37 to family, to friends, to community,
06:40 are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
06:45 than people who are less well connected.
06:48 And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
06:52 People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
06:57 find that they are less happy,
07:00 their health declines earlier in midlife,
07:03 their brain functioning declines sooner
07:05 and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
07:10 And the sad fact is that at any given time,
07:13 more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
07:19 And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
07:22 and you can be lonely in a marriage,
07:24 so the second big lesson that we learned
07:27 is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
07:30 and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
07:33 but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
07:39 It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
07:43 High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
07:47 turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
07:53 And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
07:58 Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
08:01 we wanted to look back at them at midlife
08:04 and to see if we could predict
08:06 who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
08:10 and who wasn't.
08:12 And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
08:16 at age 50,
08:18 it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
08:21 that predicted how they were going to grow old.
08:24 It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
08:27 The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
08:32 were the healthiest at age 80.
08:36 And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
08:39 from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
08:43 Our most happily partnered men and women
08:47 reported, in their 80s,
08:49 that on the days when they had more physical pain,
08:52 their mood stayed just as happy.
08:54 But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
08:58 on the days when they reported more physical pain,
09:01 it was magnified by more emotional pain.
09:04 And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
09:09 is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
09:12 they protect our brains.
09:14 It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
09:19 to another person in your 80s is protective,
09:23 that the people who are in relationships
09:25 where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
09:29 those people's memories stay sharper longer.
09:33 And the people in relationships
09:34 where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
09:38 those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
09:43 And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
09:46 Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
09:50 day in and day out,
09:51 but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
09:55 when the going got tough,
09:56 those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:02 So this message,
10:04 that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10 this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13 Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:18 Well, we're human.
10:19 What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:22 something we can get
10:24 that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27 Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:31 and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:35 it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37 It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:41 The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:46 were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:52 Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:55 many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58 really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02 were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06 But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10 that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16 with family, with friends, with community.
11:21 So what about you?
11:23 Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:28 What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:32 Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:36 It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:42 or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46 long walks or date nights,
11:49 or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54 because those all-too-common family feuds
11:58 take a terrible toll
12:00 on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04 I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
12:09 More than a century ago,
12:12 he was looking back on his life,
12:14 and he wrote this:
12:17 "There isn't time, so brief is life,
12:21 for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
12:27 There is only time for loving,
12:30 and but an instant, so to speak, for that."
12:35 The good life is built with good relationships.
12:39 Thank you.
