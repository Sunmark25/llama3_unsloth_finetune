00:13 Just over a year ago,
00:15 for the third time in my life, I ceased to exist.
00:17 I was having a small operation, and my brain was filling with anesthetic.
00:23 I remember a sense of detachment and falling apart
00:26 and a coldness.
00:28 And then I was back, drowsy and disoriented,
00:30 but definitely there.
00:32 Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,
00:34 you might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping,
00:37 but there's always a basic sense of time having passed,
00:40 of a continuity between then and now.
00:42 Coming round from anesthesia is very different.
00:45 I could have been under for five minutes, five hours,
00:47 five years or even 50 years.
00:49 I simply wasn't there.
00:50 It was total oblivion.
00:52 Anesthesia -- it's a modern kind of magic.
00:54 It turns people into objects,
00:57 and then, we hope, back again into people.
00:59 And in this process
01:01 is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy.
01:04 How does consciousness happen?
01:06 Somehow, within each of our brains,
01:08 the combined activity of many billions of neurons,
01:11 each one a tiny biological machine,
01:14 is generating a conscious experience.
01:16 And not just any conscious experience --
01:18 your conscious experience right here and right now.
01:20 How does this happen?
01:23 Answering this question is so important
01:25 because consciousness for each of us is all there is.
01:27 Without it there's no world,
01:30 there's no self,
01:32 there's nothing at all.
01:33 And when we suffer, we suffer consciously
01:35 whether it's through mental illness or pain.
01:38 And if we can experience joy and suffering,
01:41 what about other animals?
01:43 Might they be conscious, too?
01:45 Do they also have a sense of self?
01:46 And as computers get faster and smarter,
01:50 maybe there will come a point, maybe not too far away,
01:52 when my iPhone develops a sense of its own existence.
01:55 I actually think the prospects for a conscious AI are pretty remote.
01:60 And I think this because my research is telling me
02:02 that consciousness has less to do with pure intelligence
02:05 and more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms.
02:10 Consciousness and intelligence are very different things.
02:12 You don't have to be smart to suffer, but you probably do have to be alive.
02:17 In the story I'm going to tell you,
02:19 our conscious experiences of the world around us,
02:21 and of ourselves within it,
02:23 are kinds of controlled hallucinations
02:25 that happen with, through and because of our living bodies.
02:30 Now, you might have heard that we know nothing
02:32 about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness.
02:36 Some people even say it's beyond the reach of science altogether.
02:39 But in fact,
02:40 the last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area.
02:45 If you come to my lab at the University of Sussex,
02:47 you'll find scientists from all different disciplines
02:50 and sometimes even philosophers.
02:54 All of us together trying to understand how consciousness happens
02:58 and what happens when it goes wrong.
02:60 And the strategy is very simple.
03:02 I'd like you to think about consciousness
03:04 in the way that we've come to think about life.
03:06 At one time, people thought the property of being alive
03:09 could not be explained by physics and chemistry --
03:12 that life had to be more than just mechanism.
03:14 But people no longer think that.
03:16 As biologists got on with the job
03:18 of explaining the properties of living systems
03:20 in terms of physics and chemistry --
03:22 things like metabolism, reproduction, homeostasis --
03:26 the basic mystery of what life is started to fade away,
03:29 and people didn't propose any more magical solutions,
03:32 like a force of life or an Ã©lan vital.
03:35 So as with life, so with consciousness.
03:38 Once we start explaining its properties
03:40 in terms of things happening inside brains and bodies,
03:44 the apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is
03:47 should start to fade away.
03:49 At least that's the plan.
03:51 So let's get started.
03:53 What are the properties of consciousness?
03:55 What should a science of consciousness try to explain?
03:58 Well, for today I'd just like to think of consciousness in two different ways.
04:02 There are experiences of the world around us,
04:04 full of sights, sounds and smells,
04:06 there's multisensory, panoramic, 3D, fully immersive inner movie.
04:11 And then there's conscious self.
04:13 The specific experience of being you or being me.
04:16 The lead character in this inner movie,
04:18 and probably the aspect of consciousness we all cling to most tightly.
04:22 Let's start with experiences of the world around us,
04:24 and with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine.
04:28 Imagine being a brain.
04:31 You're locked inside a bony skull,
04:32 trying to figure what's out there in the world.
04:35 There's no lights inside the skull. There's no sound either.
04:38 All you've got to go on is streams of electrical impulses
04:40 which are only indirectly related to things in the world,
04:44 whatever they may be.
04:46 So perception -- figuring out what's there --
04:48 has to be a process of informed guesswork
04:51 in which the brain combines these sensory signals
04:54 with its prior expectations or beliefs about the way the world is
04:58 to form its best guess of what caused those signals.
05:01 The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.
05:04 What we perceive is its best guess of what's out there in the world.
05:09 Let me give you a couple of examples of all this.
05:12 You might have seen this illusion before,
05:14 but I'd like you to think about it in a new way.
05:17 If you look at those two patches, A and B,
05:19 they should look to you to be very different shades of gray, right?
05:23 But they are in fact exactly the same shade.
05:26 And I can illustrate this.
05:27 If I put up a second version of the image here
05:30 and join the two patches with a gray-colored bar,
05:33 you can see there's no difference.
05:34 It's exactly the same shade of gray.
05:36 And if you still don't believe me,
05:38 I'll bring the bar across and join them up.
05:41 It's a single colored block of gray, there's no difference at all.
05:45 This isn't any kind of magic trick.
05:46 It's the same shade of gray,
05:48 but take it away again, and it looks different.
05:51 So what's happening here
05:52 is that the brain is using its prior expectations
05:55 built deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex
05:58 that a cast shadow dims the appearance of a surface,
06:01 so that we see B as lighter than it really is.
06:06 Here's one more example,
06:07 which shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions
06:10 to change what we consciously experience.
06:13 Have a listen to this.
06:19 Sounded strange, right?
06:21 Have a listen again and see if you can get anything.
06:28 Still strange.
06:29 Now listen to this. is a really terrible idea.
06:35 Which I do.
06:36 So you heard some words there, right?
06:38 Now listen to the first sound again. I'm just going to replay it.
06:45 Yeah? So you can now hear words there.
06:47 Once more for luck.
06:53 OK, so what's going on here?
06:55 The remarkable thing is the sensory information coming into the brain
06:59 hasn't changed at all.
07:01 All that's changed is your brain's best guess
07:03 of the causes of that sensory information.
07:05 And that changes what you consciously hear.
07:09 All this puts the brain basis of perception
07:12 in a bit of a different light.
07:13 Instead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain
07:17 from the outside world,
07:19 it depends as much, if not more,
07:21 on perceptual predictions flowing in the opposite direction.
07:26 We don't just passively perceive the world,
07:28 we actively generate it.
07:30 The world we experience comes as much, if not more,
07:33 from the inside out
07:34 as from the outside in.
07:36 Let me give you one more example of perception
07:38 as this active, constructive process.
07:41 Here we've combined immersive virtual reality with image processing
07:47 to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions
07:50 on experience.
07:51 In this panoramic video, we've transformed the world --
07:54 which is in this case Sussex campus --
07:56 into a psychedelic playground.
07:58 We've processed the footage using an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream
08:02 to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions.
08:06 In this case, to see dogs.
08:07 And you can see this is a very strange thing.
08:10 When perceptual predictions are too strong,
08:12 as they are here,
08:13 the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations
08:16 people might report in altered states,
08:18 or perhaps even in psychosis.
08:21 Now, think about this for a minute.
08:23 If hallucination is a kind of uncontrolled perception,
08:28 then perception right here and right now is also a kind of hallucination,
08:33 but a controlled hallucination
08:35 in which the brain's predictions are being reined in
08:38 by sensory information from the world.
08:40 In fact, we're all hallucinating all the time,
08:43 including right now.
08:45 It's just that when we agree about our hallucinations,
08:47 we call that reality.
08:53 Now I'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self,
08:57 the specific experience of being you,
08:58 is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain.
09:02 This seems a very strange idea, right?
09:04 Yes, visual illusions might deceive my eyes,
09:06 but how could I be deceived about what it means to be me?
09:10 For most of us,
09:11 the experience of being a person
09:13 is so familiar, so unified and so continuous
09:15 that it's difficult not to take it for granted.
09:17 But we shouldn't take it for granted.
09:19 There are in fact many different ways we experience being a self.
09:22 There's the experience of having a body
09:25 and of being a body.
09:26 There are experiences of perceiving the world
09:28 from a first person point of view.
09:30 There are experiences of intending to do things
09:32 and of being the cause of things that happen in the world.
09:36 And there are experiences
09:37 of being a continuous and distinctive person over time,
09:41 built from a rich set of memories and social interactions.
09:44 Many experiments show,
09:45 and psychiatrists and neurologists know very well,
09:48 that these different ways in which we experience being a self
09:51 can all come apart.
09:52 What this means is the basic background experience
09:55 of being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain.
10:00 Another experience, which just like all others,
10:03 requires explanation.
10:05 So let's return to the bodily self.
10:06 How does the brain generate the experience of being a body
10:09 and of having a body?
10:11 Well, just the same principles apply.
10:12 The brain makes its best guess
10:14 about what is and what is not part of its body.
10:17 And there's a beautiful experiment in neuroscience to illustrate this.
10:21 And unlike most neuroscience experiments,
10:23 this is one you can do at home.
10:24 All you need is one of these.
10:27 And a couple of paintbrushes.
10:31 In the rubber hand illusion,
10:32 a person's real hand is hidden from view,
10:34 and that fake rubber hand is placed in front of them.
10:37 Then both hands are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush
10:40 while the person stares at the fake hand.
10:43 Now, for most people, after a while,
10:45 this leads to the very uncanny sensation
10:47 that the fake hand is in fact part of their body.
10:52 And the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch
10:56 on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be,
11:00 is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess
11:03 that the fake hand is in fact part of the body.
11:15 So you can measure all kinds of clever things.
11:17 You can measure skin conductance and startle responses,
11:21 but there's no need.
11:22 It's clear the guy in blue has assimilated the fake hand.
11:25 This means that even experiences of what our body is
11:28 is a kind of best guessing --
11:30 a kind of controlled hallucination by the brain.
11:33 There's one more thing.
11:36 We don't just experience our bodies as objects in the world from the outside,
11:40 we also experience them from within.
11:42 We all experience the sense of being a body from the inside.
11:47 And sensory signals coming from the inside of the body
11:50 are continually telling the brain about the state of the internal organs,
11:54 how the heart is doing, what the blood pressure is like,
11:56 lots of things.
11:58 This kind of perception, which we call interoception,
12:01 is rather overlooked.
12:02 But it's critically important
12:03 because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body --
12:07 well, that's what keeps us alive.
12:09 Here's another version of the rubber hand illusion.
12:11 This is from our lab at Sussex.
12:13 And here, people see a virtual reality version of their hand,
12:17 which flashes red and back
12:18 either in time or out of time with their heartbeat.
12:21 And when it's flashing in time with their heartbeat,
12:24 people have a stronger sense that it's in fact part of their body.
12:28 So experiences of having a body are deeply grounded
12:31 in perceiving our bodies from within.
12:36 There's one last thing I want to draw your attention to,
12:38 which is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different
12:42 from experiences of the world around us.
12:44 When I look around me, the world seems full of objects --
12:47 tables, chairs, rubber hands,
12:49 people, you lot --
12:51 even my own body in the world,
12:53 I can perceive it as an object from the outside.
12:55 But my experiences of the body from within,
12:57 they're not like that at all.
12:59 I don't perceive my kidneys here,
13:01 my liver here,
13:02 my spleen ...
13:04 I don't know where my spleen is,
13:05 but it's somewhere.
13:07 I don't perceive my insides as objects.
13:09 In fact, I don't experience them much at all unless they go wrong.
13:13 And this is important, I think.
13:16 Perception of the internal state of the body
13:18 isn't about figuring out what's there,
13:20 it's about control and regulation --
13:22 keeping the physiological variables within the tight bounds
13:25 that are compatible with survival.
13:29 When the brain uses predictions to figure out what's there,
13:31 we perceive objects as the causes of sensations.
13:35 When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things,
13:38 we experience how well or how badly that control is going.
13:42 So our most basic experiences of being a self,
13:45 of being an embodied organism,
13:47 are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
13:53 And when we follow this idea all the way through,
13:55 we can start to see that all of our conscious experiences,
13:59 since they all depend on the same mechanisms of predictive perception,
14:04 all stem from this basic drive to stay alive.
14:07 We experience the world and ourselves
14:10 with, through and because of our living bodies.
14:14 Let me bring things together step-by-step.
14:17 What we consciously see depends
14:18 on the brain's best guess of what's out there.
14:20 Our experienced world comes from the inside out,
14:23 not just the outside in.
14:25 The rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences
14:28 of what is and what is not our body.
14:31 And these self-related predictions depend critically on sensory signals
14:34 coming from deep inside the body.
14:36 And finally,
14:38 experiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation
14:42 than figuring out what's there.
14:45 So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it --
14:48 well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations
14:50 that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution
14:53 to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity.
14:56 We predict ourselves into existence.
15:01 Now, I leave you with three implications of all this.
15:04 First, just as we can misperceive the world,
15:06 we can misperceive ourselves
15:08 when the mechanisms of prediction go wrong.
15:10 Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,
15:14 because we can finally get at the mechanisms
15:17 rather than just treating the symptoms
15:19 in conditions like depression and schizophrenia.
15:22 Second:
15:23 what it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to
15:26 a software program running on a robot,
15:29 however smart or sophisticated.
15:31 We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals
15:34 whose conscious experiences are shaped at all levels
15:37 by the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
15:40 Just making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient.
15:45 Finally,
15:46 our own individual inner universe,
15:48 our way of being conscious,
15:50 is just one possible way of being conscious.
15:54 And even human consciousness generally --
15:56 it's just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses.
15:60 Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us,
16:03 but they're all grounded in biological mechanisms
16:07 shared with many other living creatures.
16:10 Now, these are fundamental changes
16:14 in how we understand ourselves,
16:16 but I think they should be celebrated,
16:18 because as so often in science, from Copernicus --
16:20 we're not at the center of the universe --
16:22 to Darwin --
16:24 we're related to all other creatures --
16:26 to the present day.
16:28 With a greater sense of understanding
16:31 comes a greater sense of wonder,
16:33 and a greater realization
16:35 that we are part of and not apart from the rest of nature.
16:41 And ...
16:43 when the end of consciousness comes,
16:45 there's nothing to be afraid of.
16:49 Nothing at all.
16:50 Thank you.
