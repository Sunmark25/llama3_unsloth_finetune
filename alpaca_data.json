    "output": "故事的开头是这样的：我在一个朋友家里 在她的架子上有一本《DSM手册》 就是《精神疾病诊断与统计手册》 它列举了所有已知的精神疾病 而在50年代的时候，它还是本苗条的小册子 然后一步一步被增加成大胖子 现在已经有886页厚了 目前手册列举了374种精神疾病 所以我大致翻阅了一下 好奇我是否有任何精神疾病 结果显示我得了12种 （笑声） 我得了广泛性焦虑症 这是与生俱来的 我还得了梦魇症 这是根据分类得来的 只要你周期性地梦见被追逐或者被宣判失败 而我的梦里都有人在街道上追赶我 向我叫道,\"你太失败了\" （笑声） 我还有亲子关系问题 这得归咎于我父母 （笑声） 我开玩笑的，我还真没开玩笑 好吧，开玩笑的 我还得了诈病症 我觉得同时拥有诈病症和广泛性焦虑症 这并不是很常见 因为诈病症会让我觉得非常焦虑 总之我浏览了这本书 惊讶我比我想象中还要不正常 又或许给自己诊断精神病并不是一个很好的想法 如果你不是一个受过培训的专家 又或许精神病学专家有一种怪癖 想要将正常的人类行为定义为精神疾病 我不知道这哪些是真的 但我觉得还蛮有趣的 然后我想我应该和一个精神病学评论家见一面 看看他有什么想法 所以我就和一个科学论派学者共进午餐 他叫Brian 他管理着一个一流的科学论派团队 同时也下定决心捣毁所有的精神医学 他们被称为公民人权委员会（CCHR） 我就跟他说,\"你能向我证明 精神医学是一门不值得信任的伪科学吗？” 然后他说，“可以，我证明给你看。” 我又问，“怎么证明？” 他说，“我打算介绍Tony给你认识。” 我问，“谁是Tony？\" 他说，“Tony现在在布罗德莫。” 布罗德莫，就是布罗德莫精神病院 过去被称为精神病犯人的庇护所 连环杀手就是被送到那里的 还有那些无法自控的人 我又问Brian，“Tony干过什么事？” 他说，“基本什么也没干 他好像打了人还是其他什么事 然后他决定装疯以此逃过牢狱之灾 但他装得太像了，现在就在那里出不来了 但没人相信他是正常的 你想让我们把你弄进去和Tony见面吗？” 然后我说，“嗯，劳烦你了。” 所以我踏上了前往布罗德莫精神病院的列车 我开始控制不住在坎普顿公园附近打哈欠 显然，当狗在焦虑的时候 也会情不自禁地打哈欠 之后就到了布罗德莫精神病院 然后我又不停地穿过一道又一道又一道的大门 这才进到健康中心那儿 在那里你才能和病人会面 它看起来就像大型的汉普顿酒店 到处都是桃子菠萝和让人宁静的颜色 唯一比较大胆的颜色则是应急按钮上的红色 然后病人开始挪进来 他们看起来很笨重，穿着宽松的裤子 倒是挺温顺的样子 科学论派学者Brian低声跟我说 他们这是服药后的效果 对于科学论派的人来说，这简直就是最残忍的魔鬼 我倒不觉得是件坏事 （笑声） 然后Brian说，“Tony来了。” 然后有个男人走了进来 他看起来并不笨重，身材还挺不错 也没有穿宽松的裤子 他穿着带有细条纹的西服 他张开双臂 像《飞黄腾达》里的人一样 他看起来像是想在着装方面显得得体的人 这样似乎会让我相信他是正常人 然后他坐下来 我说，“你是在这里装疯的对吧？” 他说，“对，绝对是。我在17岁的时候把别人打伤了 之后在监狱里等待审判 我的狱友跟我说 你知道你得做些什么吗 装疯 告诉他们你疯了，你就会被送到某间舒适的医院 护士会给你带来比萨饼 你会有自己的PS游戏机。” 我又说，“那你是怎么做的？” 他说，“我要求去见监狱里的精神病专家 而且我又看过《冲击效应》这部电影 电影里的人用车去撞墙以获得性快感 所以我跟精神病专家说 我通过开车撞墙活得性快感。” 我说，“还有吗？” 他说，“哦对了，我告诉那个精神病专家 我喜欢看女人死去 因为这让我觉得我比较正常。” 我说，“你这是从哪学来的？” 他说，“哦，从Ted Bundy（连环杀手）的自传 监狱图书馆里有这本书。” 总之，他说他装得太像了 结果他们没把他送到某间舒适的医院 反而送到了布罗德莫精神病院 他到这里的那一刻 他说他看了下四周的环境，然后要求去见精神病医生 说，“这当中有着难以解释的误会 我并没有任何精神疾病。” 我问，“你在这待了多长时间了？” 他说，“唉，如果我只在狱中服刑的话 我只要待五年 但我在布罗德莫精神病院已经12年了。” Tony说，要使别人相信你是正常人是十分困难的 而使别人相信你疯了则简单得多 他说，“要显得正常，我觉得最好的方法 就是和他人正常地交谈，聊一聊正常的事物 像足球或电视上的事情 我有订阅《新科学家》这份杂志 最近他们发表了一篇文章 关于美国军队训练大黄蜂来侦查爆炸物的 然后我跟护士说 你知道美国军队正在训练大黄蜂 来侦查爆炸物吗 当我看到我的医疗记录时 我看到他们写到 “相信蜜蜂能侦查爆炸物” 他说，“你知道，他们总是在寻找 非言语的线索来判断我的心理状态 但你是如何用正常人的方式坐的？"

    "output": "这简直就是天荒夜谈。” 当Tony告诉我这些的时候 我心想，“我坐得像个记者吗 我翘脚翘得像个记者吗？” 他说，“我的邻居一边住着斯托克威尔扼杀者案的凶手 另一边住着整天哼唱着踮起脚尖穿过郁金香花丛的强奸犯 因为他们其实挺可怕的，所以我大部分时间是在自己房间的 但他们将此当作发疯的征兆 他们说这表明我冷漠并浮夸。” 所以只有在这里，不想和连环杀手交往 才是发疯的征兆 总之他对我来说完全正常——但我又知道些什么呢 当我回到家时我给他的临床医生Anthony Maden发了电邮 我问，“这里面有什么故事吗？” 他说，“对，我们知道Tony装疯以逃牢狱之灾 因为起初他陈述的老掉牙的幻想 在他踏入布罗德莫精神病院那刻便了无踪影 但是，我们对他进行了测试 所以我们才决定把他诊断为精神病患者 事实上，装疯 正是一种精神病患者狡猾和控制欲强的表现行为 它就写在检核表上：狡猾且控制欲强 所以假装大脑出了问题 就是你大脑真的出问题的证据 然后我又跟其他专家交流了 他们说带条纹的西服——典型的精神病患者 证明了检核表上的第一和第二项—— 口若悬河，迷人外表和自恋的浮夸感 我又说，“好吧，那他不想和其他病人来往又怎么说呢？” 典型精神病患者——这证明了浮夸和缺乏同理心 所以那些对于Tony来说都是十分正常的事 都是病证，根据他的医生的说法 这是一种新型的发疯 他就是个精神病患者 然后他的医生又跟我说 “如果你想多一些了解精神病患者 你可以去参加“观察精神病患者课程” 是由发明“病态人格检核表”的Robert Hare授课的 我还真参加了 我报名参加了“观察精神病患者课程” 现在我是一名持证的 不得不说，还挺资深的 精神病患者观察员 这有些数据： 100个普通正常人当中就有一个精神病患者 而这个大厅里有1500人 所以当中有15个人是精神病患者 并且这个比例会在CEO和商业领导者中 上升到4% 所以我觉得这是非常难得的机会 在这个大厅里约有30到40名精神病患者 可能在今晚结束的时候会有大屠杀 （笑声） Hare解释说原因来自资本主义的冷酷无情 造就了精神疾病的行为 缺乏同理心，口若悬河 狡猾，控制欲强 事实上，或许冷酷无情的资本主义 正是精神疾病的物质表现 这也是精神疾病的一种形式 归根到底会影响着我们 Hare还跟我说，“你知道吗？别再想布罗德莫精神病院里 哪个可能装疯，哪个是真疯 谁在乎呢？那并不重要， 重要的是，”他接着说，“是企业型变态人格 你可以亲自去采访一些'企业里的精神病患者'。” 所以我就试了下。我给安然公司（Enron）写了信 我说，“我能来你们这并在狱中采访下你们 看看你们是不是精神病患者吗？” 之后就杳无音讯了 所以我换了另一种方式 我电邮了“杀手艾尔”Dunlap 90年代开始的资产掠夺者 他能让企业倒闭并失去30%的劳动力 他能将美国的城镇变成荒凉之地 所以我给他发了电邮说道 “我相信您有一颗独特异常的大脑 使您变得如此出众 您崇尚掠夺精神并且无所畏惧 那我能采访下您 关于你那颗特别独特的大脑吗？” 然后他说，“过来吧。” 所以我去了他佛罗里达的大豪宅 到处都是食肉动物的雕塑 还有狮子和老虎 他带着我穿过花园 那儿有猎鹰和老鹰 他跟我说，“在那儿你能看到鲨鱼。” 他说这话的语气还挺霸气的 “你还会看到更多的鲨鱼和老虎” 那里就像纳尼亚王国 （笑声） 之后我们来到他的厨房 现在Al Dunlap会被聘请去拯救那些濒临破产的公司 他会将劳动力减少30% 他经常会用开玩笑的口吻炒别人鱿鱼 举个例子，一个关于他的经典传闻 有人找到他，跟他说，“我刚给自己买了新车。” 他说，“你或许有了一辆新车， 但我告诉你，你没有的，是一份工作。” 话说在厨房——他正和妻子Judy站在一起 还有他的保镖Sean，然后我会说，“你记得我在电邮里写的 关于你有一颗让你出众的独特奇异的大脑吗？” 他说，“记得，这说法还真不赖 感觉就像《星际迷航》一样。现在还没人做到像你这样。” 然后我又说，“其实，一些心理学家或许会说 这颗大脑让你变成...”（ 喃喃而语） （笑声） 他紧接着问，“啥？” 我说，“一个疯子。” 我接着说，“我口袋里有张清单列举了些精神病患特征 我能和你将这些过一遍吗？” 尽管他自己看起来很迷惑 但他还是说，“行，继续。” 我说，“那开始吧。自我价值的浮夸感。” 就这个，我得说，他还挺难去否认的 因为他就站在一幅巨大的油画自画像下面 （笑声） 他说，“好吧，你总要相信自己对吧！” 我又接着，“控制欲强。” 他说，“这叫领导能力。” 我接着，“淡化影响： 无法承受一系列的情绪波动 他说，“谁又想被无意义的情绪波动给压倒呢？” 接着他过了一遍精神病检核表 基本和《谁动了我的奶酪》里面一样（为自己辩解） （笑声） 但我确实觉察到和Al Dunlap在一起的那天发生的一些事 无论他说什么，我听起来都觉得挺正常的 就像他反对少年违法犯罪一样 他说他被西点军校（West Point）录取了 在西点军校是不允许有过失的 他反对很多短期的婚姻关系 他只结过两次婚 无可否认，他第一任妻子是在他拿刀威胁下 才在离婚协议上签字的 他妻子说他一直很好奇人肉尝起来是怎样的 但人们总会在失败的婚姻争吵中说些傻话 而他的第二段婚姻持续了41年 所以无论他说什么，我听起来都不觉得他有精神病 我心想，好吧，我不打算把这些写进书里 但之后我意识到成为一个精神病患观察员 倒是让我变得有点神神颠颠的 因为我拼命想证明他是神经病患者 我拼命想用他最疯狂的举动来判定 突然我意识到，天啊，我干这都干了20年了 记者就都是做这些啊 我们带着笔记本走遍世界 等待着劲爆的料子 而所谓的料子却总是那些和被采访人的人格 相差得十万八千里的花边 我们像中世纪僧侣（文化智慧的象征）将他们联系起来 却把那些正常的方面抛掷脑外 而这正是一个大量过度诊断精神疾病的国家 儿童双相障碍症——约4岁的儿童 被诊断为双相障碍症 因为他们脾气暴躁 这在双相障碍症的检核表上位居榜首 当我回到伦敦时，Tony给我打了电话 他说，“你为什么还没给我回电？” 我说，“因为他们说你确实有精神病。” 他说，“我没精神病。” 他说，“你知道吗，检核表上有一项是缺乏懊悔 但另一项却是狡猾，且控制欲强 所以当你说你对犯罪感到懊悔时 他们会说，典型的精神病患者 狡猾地欺骗说他感到懊悔，其实不然 这就像巫术，他们完全颠覆了一切。” 他说，“我接下来有个裁决 你要来吗？” 然后我答应了 之后我去了那个裁决 在布罗德莫精神病院住了14年后，他们总算让他离开了 他们决定说他不应该被无限期拘留 因为他在检核表上分数很高 这意味着他再犯的几率要比平均数还高 所以他们让他离开了 就在外面的走廊他跟我说 “Jon，你知道吗 每个人多少都有精神病。” 他说，“你有，我有，显然我是有的。” 我说，“那你现在准备干什么呢？” 他说，“我打算去比利时 因为那里有个我喜欢的女人 但她结婚了，所以我准备去让她和她丈夫离婚。” （笑声） 总之，那是两年前的事了 也是我书的最后情节 过去的20个月，一切正常 安然无恙 他和一个女孩住在伦敦以外 按照科学论派学者Brian的说法 他在弥补失去的时间——我知道这听起来不是好兆头 不过也说不定 20个月后，很可惜 他又回到监狱里待了一个月 他在酒吧里和别人发生争吵，他是这样说的 所以在监狱里待了一个月 我知道这并不好 但至少一个月的刑期，说明不管是什么争吵 后果应该不算严重 然后他打电话给我 知道吗，我觉得Tony出来是对的 因为你不能单靠人的疯狂举止就去判定他们 那Tony算什么呢，算半个疯子吧 他处在世界上一个不像灰色地带的灰色地带 这个灰色地带是复杂和纠结的聚集地 在这你能看到人道 也能看到真相 Tony跟我说 “Jon，我能请你去酒吧喝一杯吗？"
