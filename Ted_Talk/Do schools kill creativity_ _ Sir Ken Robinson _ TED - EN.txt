00:27 Good morning. How are you?
00:30 (Audience) Good.
00:31 It's been great, hasn't it?
00:33 I've been blown away by the whole thing.
00:36 In fact, I'm leaving.
00:43 There have been three themes
running through the conference,
00:47 which are relevant
to what I want to talk about.
00:49 One is the extraordinary
evidence of human creativity
00:53 in all of the presentations that we've had
00:56 and in all of the people here;
00:58 just the variety of it
and the range of it.
01:01 The second is that it's put us in a place
01:03 where we have no idea
what's going to happen
01:06 in terms of the future.
01:07 No idea how this may play out.
01:10 I have an interest in education.
01:12 Actually, what I find is,
everybody has an interest in education.
01:16 Don't you?
01:18 I find this very interesting.
01:19 If you're at a dinner party,
and you say you work in education --
01:23 actually, you're not often
at dinner parties, frankly.
01:30 If you work in education,
you're not asked.
01:35 And you're never asked back, curiously.
That's strange to me.
01:39 But if you are, and you say to somebody,
01:42 you know, they say, "What do you do?"
01:43 and you say you work in education,
01:45 you can see the blood run from their face.
01:47 They're like, "Oh my God. Why me?"
01:51 "My one night out all week."
01:55 But if you ask about their education,
they pin you to the wall,
01:59 because it's one of those things
that goes deep with people, am I right?
02:02 Like religion and money and other things.
02:06 So I have a big interest in education,
and I think we all do.
02:10 We have a huge vested interest in it,
02:12 partly because it's education
that's meant to take us into this future
02:15 that we can't grasp.
02:17 If you think of it,
02:18 children starting school this year
will be retiring in 2065.
02:25 Nobody has a clue,
02:27 despite all the expertise that's been
on parade for the past four days,
02:30 what the world will look like
in five years' time.
02:33 And yet, we're meant
to be educating them for it.
02:35 So the unpredictability,
I think, is extraordinary.
02:38 And the third part of this
is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,
02:41 on the really extraordinary
capacities that children have --
02:47 their capacities for innovation.
02:49 I mean, Sirena last night
was a marvel, wasn't she?
02:52 Just seeing what she could do.
02:54 And she's exceptional, but I think
she's not, so to speak,
02:59 exceptional in the whole of childhood.
03:02 What you have there is a person
of extraordinary dedication
03:05 who found a talent.
03:06 And my contention is,
all kids have tremendous talents,
03:09 and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.
03:11 So I want to talk about education,
03:13 and I want to talk about creativity.
03:15 My contention is that creativity now
is as important in education as literacy,
03:21 and we should treat it
with the same status.
03:24 (Applause)
03:25 Thank you.
03:26 (Applause)
03:30 That was it, by the way.
Thank you very much.
03:35 So, 15 minutes left.
03:40 "Well, I was born ... "
03:45 I heard a great story recently --
I love telling it --
03:48 of a little girl
who was in a drawing lesson.
03:50 She was six, and she was
at the back, drawing,
03:52 and the teacher said this girl
hardly ever paid attention,
03:55 and in this drawing lesson, she did.
03:57 The teacher was fascinated.
03:58 She went over to her,
and she said, "What are you drawing?"
04:01 And the girl said,
"I'm drawing a picture of God."
04:05 And the teacher said, "But nobody
knows what God looks like."
04:08 And the girl said,
"They will in a minute."
04:22 When my son was four in England --
04:24 actually, he was four
everywhere, to be honest.
04:28 If we're being strict about it,
wherever he went, he was four that year.
04:32 He was in the Nativity play.
Do you remember the story?
04:36 No, it was big, it was a big story.
04:38 Mel Gibson did the sequel,
you may have seen it.
04:41 "Nativity II."
04:43 But James got the part of Joseph,
which we were thrilled about.
04:47 We considered this to be
one of the lead parts.
04:50 We had the place crammed
full of agents in T-shirts:
04:52 "James Robinson IS Joseph!"
04:55 He didn't have to speak, but you know
the bit where the three kings come in?
04:58 They come in bearing gifts,
gold, frankincense and myrrh.
05:01 This really happened.
05:02 We were sitting there, and I think
they just went out of sequence,
05:05 because we talked to the little boy
afterward and said,
05:08 "You OK with that?" They said,
"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"
05:11 They just switched.
05:12 The three boys came in, four-year-olds
with tea towels on their heads.
05:15 They put these boxes down, and the first
boy said, "I bring you gold."
05:19 And the second boy said,
"I bring you myrrh."
05:21 And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."
05:36 What these things have in common
is that kids will take a chance.
05:39 If they don't know, they'll have a go.
05:42 Am I right? They're not
frightened of being wrong.
05:46 I don't mean to say that being wrong
is the same thing as being creative.
05:50 What we do know is,
if you're not prepared to be wrong,
05:53 you'll never come up
with anything original --
05:55 if you're not prepared to be wrong.
05:58 And by the time they get to be adults,
most kids have lost that capacity.
06:02 They have become
frightened of being wrong.
06:05 And we run our companies like this.
06:07 We stigmatize mistakes.
06:08 And we're now running
national education systems
06:11 where mistakes are the worst
thing you can make.
06:14 And the result is that
we are educating people
06:17 out of their creative capacities.
06:19 Picasso once said this, he said
that all children are born artists.
06:24 The problem is to remain
an artist as we grow up.
06:27 I believe this passionately,
that we don't grow into creativity,
06:30 we grow out of it.
06:32 Or rather, we get educated out of it.
06:35 So why is this?
06:37 I lived in Stratford-on-Avon
until about five years ago.
06:40 In fact, we moved from Stratford
to Los Angeles.
06:43 So you can imagine
what a seamless transition this was.
06:47 Actually, we lived in a place
called Snitterfield,
06:49 just outside Stratford,
06:51 which is where
Shakespeare's father was born.
06:53 Are you struck by a new thought? I was.
06:55 You don't think of Shakespeare
having a father, do you?
06:58 Do you?
06:59 Because you don't think
of Shakespeare being a child, do you?
07:02 Shakespeare being seven?
07:04 I never thought of it.
07:05 I mean, he was seven at some point.
07:07 He was in somebody's
English class, wasn't he?
07:16 How annoying would that be?
07:25 "Must try harder."
07:31 Being sent to bed by his dad,
to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!"
07:34 To William Shakespeare.
07:35 "And put the pencil down!"
07:37 "And stop speaking like that."
07:42 "It's confusing everybody."
07:49 Anyway, we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles,
07:54 and I just want to say a word
about the transition.
07:57 Actually, my son didn't want to come.
07:58 I've got two kids;
he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.
08:01 He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.
08:03 He loved it, but he had
a girlfriend in England.
08:07 This was the love of his life, Sarah.
08:10 He'd known her for a month.
08:13 Mind you, they'd had
their fourth anniversary,
08:16 because it's a long time when you're 16.
08:18 He was really upset on the plane.
08:19 He said, "I'll never find
another girl like Sarah."
08:22 And we were rather pleased
about that, frankly --
08:32 because she was the main reason
we were leaving the country.
08:41 But something strikes you
when you move to America
08:44 and travel around the world:
08:45 every education system on earth
has the same hierarchy of subjects.
08:49 Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.
08:51 You'd think it would be
otherwise, but it isn't.
08:53 At the top are mathematics and languages,
then the humanities.
08:56 At the bottom are the arts.
Everywhere on earth.
08:58 And in pretty much every system, too,
there's a hierarchy within the arts.
09:03 Art and music are normally given
a higher status in schools
09:05 than drama and dance.
09:07 There isn't an education
system on the planet
09:09 that teaches dance every day to children
09:11 the way we teach them mathematics.
09:13 Why?
09:14 Why not?
09:15 I think this is rather important.
09:17 I think math is very important,
but so is dance.
09:19 Children dance all the time
if they're allowed to, we all do.
09:22 We all have bodies, don't we?
Did I miss a meeting?
09:28 Truthfully, what happens is,
as children grow up,
09:30 we start to educate them progressively
from the waist up.
09:33 And then we focus on their heads.
09:34 And slightly to one side.
09:37 If you were to visit education as an alien
09:39 and say "What's it for, public education?"
09:42 I think you'd have to conclude,
if you look at the output,
09:45 who really succeeds by this,
09:46 who does everything they should,
09:48 who gets all the brownie points,
who are the winners --
09:51 I think you'd have to conclude
the whole purpose of public education
09:54 throughout the world
09:55 is to produce university professors.
09:58 Isn't it?
09:59 They're the people who come out the top.
10:01 And I used to be one, so there.
10:06 And I like university professors,
10:08 but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up
10:10 as the high-water mark
of all human achievement.
10:13 They're just a form of life.
10:15 Another form of life.
10:17 But they're rather curious.
10:18 And I say this out of affection for them:
10:20 there's something curious
about professors.
10:22 In my experience -- not all of them,
but typically -- they live in their heads.
10:26 They live up there
and slightly to one side.
10:28 They're disembodied, you know,
in a kind of literal way.
10:32 They look upon their body as a form
of transport for their heads.
10:41 Don't they?
10:43 It's a way of getting
their head to meetings.
10:50 If you want real evidence
of out-of-body experiences, by the way,
10:54 get yourself along to a residential
conference of senior academics
10:57 and pop into the discotheque
on the final night.
11:02 And there, you will see it.
11:04 Grown men and women
writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.
11:11 Waiting until it ends, so they can
go home and write a paper about it.
11:16 Our education system is predicated
on the idea of academic ability.
11:20 And there's a reason.
11:21 Around the world, there were
no public systems of education,
11:25 really, before the 19th century.
11:27 They all came into being
to meet the needs of industrialism.
11:30 So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.
11:32 Number one, that the most useful
subjects for work are at the top.
11:37 So you were probably steered benignly away
from things at school
11:40 when you were a kid,
11:41 things you liked,
11:42 on the grounds you would never
get a job doing that.
11:45 Is that right?
11:46 "Don't do music, you're not
going to be a musician;
11:49 don't do art, you won't be an artist."
11:50 Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.
11:53 The whole world
is engulfed in a revolution.
11:55 And the second is academic ability,
11:57 which has really come to dominate
our view of intelligence,
12:00 because the universities design
the system in their image.
12:03 If you think of it,
12:04 the whole system of public education
around the world is a protracted process
12:08 of university entrance.
12:09 And the consequence is
that many highly talented,
12:11 brilliant, creative people
think they're not,
12:14 because the thing
they were good at at school
12:16 wasn't valued,
or was actually stigmatized.
12:18 And I think we can't afford
to go on that way.
12:21 In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,
12:23 more people worldwide will be
graduating through education
12:26 than since the beginning of history.
12:29 More people.
12:30 And it's the combination
of all the things we've talked about:
12:33 technology and its
transformational effect on work,
12:35 and demography and the huge
explosion in population.
12:38 Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.
12:40 Isn't that true?
12:42 When I was a student,
if you had a degree, you had a job.
12:45 If you didn't have a job,
it's because you didn't want one.
12:48 And I didn't want one, frankly.
12:52 But now kids with degrees
are often heading home
12:55 to carry on playing video games,
12:57 because you need an MA
where the previous job required a BA,
13:00 and now you need a PhD for the other.
13:02 It's a process of academic inflation.
13:04 And it indicates the whole structure
of education is shifting beneath our feet.
13:08 We need to radically rethink
our view of intelligence.
13:10 We know three things about intelligence.
13:12 One, it's diverse.
13:13 We think about the world in all the ways
that we experience it.
13:16 We think visually, we think in sound,
we think kinesthetically.
13:19 We think in abstract terms,
we think in movement.
13:22 Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.
13:25 If you look at the interactions
of a human brain,
13:27 as we heard yesterday
from a number of presentations,
13:30 intelligence is wonderfully interactive.
13:32 The brain isn't divided into compartments.
13:35 In fact, creativity --
13:36 which I define as the process of having
original ideas that have value --
13:41 more often than not comes about
13:42 through the interaction of different
disciplinary ways of seeing things.
13:47 By the way, there's a shaft of nerves
that joins the two halves of the brain,
13:51 called the corpus callosum.
13:52 It's thicker in women.
13:54 Following off from Helen yesterday,
13:56 this is probably why women
are better at multitasking.
13:59 Because you are, aren't you?
14:01 There's a raft of research,
but I know it from my personal life.
14:05 If my wife is cooking a meal
at home, which is not often ...
14:09 thankfully.
14:13 No, she's good at some things.
14:15 But if she's cooking,
she's dealing with people on the phone,
14:18 she's talking to the kids,
she's painting the ceiling --
14:21 she's doing open-heart surgery over here.
14:23 If I'm cooking, the door
is shut, the kids are out,
14:26 the phone's on the hook,
14:28 if she comes in, I get annoyed.
14:29 I say, "Terry, please,
I'm trying to fry an egg in here."
14:39 "Give me a break."
14:42 Actually, do you know
that old philosophical thing,
14:45 "If a tree falls in a forest,
and nobody hears it, did it happen?"
14:48 Remember that old chestnut?
14:50 I saw a great T-shirt
recently, which said,
14:53 "If a man speaks his mind in a forest,
and no woman hears him,
14:56 is he still wrong?"
15:05 And the third thing about intelligence is,
15:07 it's distinct.
15:09 I'm doing a new book at the moment
called "Epiphany,"
15:12 which is based on a series
of interviews with people
15:14 about how they discovered their talent.
15:16 I'm fascinated by
how people got to be there.
15:18 It's really prompted by a conversation
I had with a wonderful woman
15:21 who maybe most people
have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.
15:24 Have you heard of her? Some have.
15:26 She's a choreographer,
and everybody knows her work.
15:28 She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."
15:30 She's wonderful.
15:31 I used to be on the board
of The Royal Ballet, as you can see.
15:36 Gillian and I had lunch one day.
I said, "How did you get to be a dancer?"
15:40 It was interesting.
15:41 When she was at school,
she was really hopeless.
15:43 And the school, in the '30s,
wrote to her parents and said,
15:46 "We think Gillian
has a learning disorder."
15:48 She couldn't concentrate;
she was fidgeting.
15:50 I think now they'd say she had ADHD.
15:52 Wouldn't you?
15:54 But this was the 1930s, and ADHD
hadn't been invented at this point.
15:58 It wasn't an available condition.
16:03 People weren't aware they could have that.
16:08 Anyway, she went to see this specialist.
16:12 So, this oak-paneled room,
and she was there with her mother,
16:15 and she was led and sat
on this chair at the end,
16:18 and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes,
16:20 while this man talked to her mother
16:21 about all the problems
Gillian was having at school,
16:24 because she was disturbing people,
her homework was always late, and so on.
16:28 Little kid of eight.
16:29 In the end, the doctor went
and sat next to Gillian and said,
16:32 "I've listened to all these
things your mother's told me.
16:34 I need to speak to her privately.
16:36 Wait here. We'll be back.
We won't be very long,"
16:38 and they went and left her.
16:41 But as they went out of the room,
16:43 he turned on the radio
that was sitting on his desk.
16:46 And when they got out of the room,
16:47 he said to her mother,
"Just stand and watch her."
16:50 And the minute they left the room,
16:52 she was on her feet, moving to the music.
16:55 And they watched for a few minutes,
and he turned to her mother and said,
16:58 "Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick.
17:00 She's a dancer.
17:03 Take her to a dance school."
17:05 I said, "What happened?"
17:06 She said, "She did. I can't tell you
how wonderful it was.
17:09 We walked in this room,
and it was full of people like me --
17:12 people who couldn't sit still,
17:14 people who had to move to think."
17:17 Who had to move to think.
17:19 They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;
they did modern; they did contemporary.
17:23 She was eventually auditioned
for the Royal Ballet School.
17:25 She became a soloist; she had
a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.
17:29 She eventually graduated
from the Royal Ballet School,
17:31 founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,
17:33 met Andrew Lloyd Webber.
17:34 She's been responsible for
17:36 some of the most successful
musical theater productions in history,
17:39 she's given pleasure to millions,
17:40 and she's a multimillionaire.
17:42 Somebody else might have put her
on medication and told her to calm down.
17:46 (Applause)
17:54 What I think it comes to is this:
17:55 Al Gore spoke the other night
17:57 about ecology and the revolution
that was triggered by Rachel Carson.
18:02 I believe our only hope for the future
18:04 is to adopt a new conception
of human ecology,
18:08 one in which we start
to reconstitute our conception
18:11 of the richness of human capacity.
18:13 Our education system has mined our minds
18:17 in the way that we strip-mine the earth
for a particular commodity.
18:20 And for the future, it won't serve us.
18:23 We have to rethink
the fundamental principles
18:25 on which we're educating our children.
18:27 There was a wonderful quote
by Jonas Salk, who said,
18:30 "If all the insects
were to disappear from the Earth,
18:35 within 50 years,
all life on Earth would end.
18:39 If all human beings
disappeared from the Earth,
18:42 within 50 years,
all forms of life would flourish."
18:45 And he's right.
18:47 What TED celebrates is the gift
of the human imagination.
18:52 We have to be careful now
that we use this gift wisely,
18:56 and that we avert some of the scenarios
that we've talked about.
18:59 And the only way we'll do it
is by seeing our creative capacities
19:03 for the richness they are
19:05 and seeing our children
for the hope that they are.
19:08 And our task is to educate
their whole being,
19:10 so they can face this future.
19:12 By the way -- we may not see this future,
19:14 but they will.
19:16 And our job is to help them
make something of it.
19:19 Thank you very much.
19:20 (Applause)
