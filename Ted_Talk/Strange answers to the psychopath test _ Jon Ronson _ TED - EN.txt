00:16 The story starts:
I was at a friend's house,
00:20 and she had on her shelf
a copy of the DSM manual,
00:24 which is the manual of mental disorders.
00:26 It lists every known mental disorder.
00:29 And it used to be, back in the '50s,
a very slim pamphlet.
00:32 And then it got bigger
and bigger and bigger,
00:35 and now it's 886 pages long.
00:38 And it lists currently
374 mental disorders.
00:43 So I was leafing through it,
00:44 wondering if I had any mental disorders,
00:47 and it turns out I've got 12.
00:49 (Laughter)
00:50 I've got generalized anxiety disorder,
00:53 which is a given.
00:54 I've got nightmare disorder,
00:56 which is categorized
00:57 if you have recurrent dreams of being
pursued or declared a failure,
01:01 and all my dreams involve people
chasing me down the street
01:05 going, "You're a failure!"
01:07 (Laughter)
01:09 I've got parent-child relational problems,
01:12 which I blame my parents for.
01:14 (Laughter)
01:16 I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.
01:18 I'm kidding.
01:20 And I've got malingering.
01:21 And I think it's actually quite rare
01:23 to have both malingering
and generalized anxiety disorder,
01:26 because malingering tends
to make me feel very anxious.
01:29 Anyway, I was looking through this book,
01:31 wondering if I was much crazier
than I thought I was,
01:33 or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose
yourself with a mental disorder
01:37 if you're not a trained professional,
01:39 or maybe the psychiatry profession
has a kind of strange desire
01:44 to label what's essentially normal
human behavior as a mental disorder.
01:48 I didn't know which of these was true,
but I thought it was kind of interesting,
01:52 and I thought maybe I should
meet a critic of psychiatry
01:55 to get their view,
01:56 which is how I ended up having
lunch with the Scientologists.
01:60 (Laughter)
02:01 It was a man called Brian,
who runs a crack team of Scientologists
02:06 who are determined to destroy
psychiatry wherever it lies.
02:10 They're called the CCHR.
02:12 And I said to him, "Can you prove to me
02:15 that psychiatry is a pseudo-science
that can't be trusted?"
02:19 And he said, "Yes,
we can prove it to you."
02:21 And I said, "How?"
02:23 And he said, "We're going
to introduce you to Tony."
02:26 And I said, "Who's Tony?"
02:28 And he said, "Tony's in Broadmoor."
02:32 Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.
02:34 It used to be known as the Broadmoor
Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
02:39 It's where they send the serial killers,
02:41 and the people who can't help themselves.
02:43 And I said to Brian,
"Well, what did Tony do?"
02:46 And he said, "Hardly anything.
02:49 He beat someone up or something,
02:52 and he decided to fake madness
to get out of a prison sentence.
02:58 But he faked it too well,
and now he's stuck in Broadmoor
03:02 and nobody will believe he's sane.
03:05 Do you want us to try and get you
into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"
03:08 So I said, "Yes, please."
03:11 So I got the train to Broadmoor.
03:12 I began to yawn uncontrollably
around Kempton Park,
03:16 which apparently is what dogs
also do when anxious,
03:19 they yawn uncontrollably.
03:21 And we got to Broadmoor.
03:23 And I got taken through gate
after gate after gate after gate
03:27 into the wellness center, which is where
you get to meet the patients.
03:31 It looks like a giant Hampton Inn.
03:34 It's all peach and pine
and calming colors.
03:38 And the only bold colors
are the reds of the panic buttons.
03:44 And the patients started drifting in.
03:47 And they were quite overweight
and wearing sweatpants,
03:51 and quite docile-looking.
03:53 And Brian the Scientologist
whispered to me,
03:55 "They're medicated,"
03:57 which, to the Scientologists,
is like the worst evil in the world,
04:01 but I'm thinking
it's probably a good idea.
04:03 (Laughter)
04:05 And then Brian said, "Here's Tony."
04:08 And a man was walking in.
04:10 And he wasn't overweight,
he was in very good physical shape.
04:14 And he wasn't wearing sweatpants,
04:16 he was wearing a pinstripe suit.
04:18 And he had his arm outstretched
04:20 like someone out of The Apprentice.
04:22 He looked like a man
who wanted to wear an outfit
04:26 that would convince me
that he was very sane.
04:30 And he sat down.
04:31 And I said, "So is it true
that you faked your way in here?"
04:35 And he said, "Yep. Yep. Absolutely.
I beat someone up when I was 17.
04:38 And I was in prison awaiting trial,
04:40 and my cellmate said to me,
04:42 'You know what you have to do?
04:43 Fake madness.
04:45 Tell them you're mad, you'll get
sent to some cushy hospital.
04:49 Nurses will bring you pizzas,
you'll have your own PlayStation.'"
04:53 I said, "Well, how did you do it?"
04:54 He said, "Well, I asked to see
the prison psychiatrist.
04:57 And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,'
04:59 in which people get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.
05:04 So I said to the psychiatrist,
05:06 'I get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.'"
05:09 And I said, "What else?"
05:11 He said, "Oh, yeah.
I told the psychiatrist
05:13 that I wanted to watch women as they died,
05:17 because it would make
me feel more normal."
05:19 I said, "Where'd you get that from?"
05:21 He said, "Oh, from a biography
of Ted Bundy that they had
05:24 at the prison library."
05:26 Anyway, he faked madness
too well, he said.
05:29 And they didn't send him
to some cushy hospital.
05:31 They sent him to Broadmoor.
05:34 And the minute he got there,
05:35 said he took one look at the place,
asked to see the psychiatrist,
05:38 said, "There's been
a terrible misunderstanding.
05:41 I'm not mentally ill."
05:43 I said, "How long have you been here for?"
05:45 He said, "Well, if I'd just
done my time in prison
05:48 for the original crime,
I'd have got five years.
05:51 I've been in Broadmoor for 12 years."
05:56 Tony said that it's a lot harder
to convince people you're sane
06:00 than it is to convince them you're crazy.
06:03 He said, "I thought
the best way to seem normal
06:05 would be to talk to people
normally about normal things
06:08 like football or what's on TV.
06:10 I subscribe to New Scientist,
06:11 and recently they had an article
06:13 about how the U.S. Army was training
bumblebees to sniff out explosives.
06:17 So I said to a nurse,
06:19 'Did you know that the U.S. Army
is training bumblebees
06:21 to sniff out explosives?'
06:24 When I read my medical notes,
I saw they'd written:
06:27 'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"
06:30 (Laughter)
06:31 He said, "You know, they're always
looking out for nonverbal clues
06:34 to my mental state.
06:36 But how do you sit in a sane way?
06:39 How do you cross your legs in a sane way?
06:41 It's just impossible."
06:43 When Tony said that to me,
06:44 I thought to myself,
"Am I sitting like a journalist?
06:48 Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"
06:51 He said, "You know, I've got
the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me,
06:56 and I've got the 'Tiptoe
Through the Tulips' rapist
06:59 on the other side of me.
07:00 So I tend to stay in my room a lot
because I find them quite frightening.
07:04 And they take that as a sign of madness.
07:06 They say it proves
that I'm aloof and grandiose."
07:10 So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting
to hang out with serial killers
07:14 be a sign of madness.
07:15 Anyway, he seemed completely normal
to me, but what did I know?
07:19 And when I got home I emailed
his clinician, Anthony Maden.
07:22 I said, "What's the story?"
07:24 And he said, "Yep.
We accept that Tony faked madness
07:27 to get out of a prison sentence,
because his hallucinations --
07:31 that had seemed
quite cliche to begin with --
07:33 just vanished the minute
he got to Broadmoor.
07:36 However, we have assessed him,
07:38 and we've determined that what he is
07:40 is a psychopath."
07:42 And in fact, faking madness
07:44 is exactly the kind of cunning
and manipulative act of a psychopath.
07:48 It's on the checklist:
cunning, manipulative.
07:51 So, faking your brain going wrong
07:53 is evidence that your brain
has gone wrong.
07:56 And I spoke to other experts,
07:58 and they said the pinstripe
suit -- classic psychopath --
08:02 speaks to items one
and two on the checklist:
08:04 glibness, superficial charm
and grandiose sense of self-worth.
08:08 And I said, "Well, but why didn't
he hang out with the other patients?"
08:12 Classic psychopath -- it speaks
to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.
08:16 So all the things that had seemed
most normal about Tony
08:19 was evidence, according to his clinician,
08:23 that he was mad in this new way.
08:25 He was a psychopath.
08:26 And his clinician said to me, "If you
want to know more about psychopaths,
08:30 you can go on a psychopath-spotting course
08:33 run by Robert Hare, who invented
the psychopath checklist."
08:36 So I did.
08:37 I went on a psychopath-spotting course,
08:39 and I am now a certified --
08:43 and I have to say, extremely adept --
psychopath spotter.
08:48 So, here's the statistics:
08:51 One in a hundred regular people
is a psychopath.
08:56 So there's 1,500 people in his room.
09:00 Fifteen of you are psychopaths.
09:05 Although that figure rises to four percent
of CEOs and business leaders,
09:10 so I think there's a very good chance
09:13 there's about 30 or 40
psychopaths in this room.
09:18 It could be carnage
by the end of the night.
09:20 (Laughter)
09:25 Hare said the reason why
is because capitalism at its most ruthless
09:30 rewards psychopathic behavior --
09:33 the lack of empathy, the glibness,
09:37 cunning, manipulative.
09:40 In fact, capitalism, perhaps
at its most remorseless,
09:43 is a physical manifestation
of psychopathy.
09:47 It's like a form of psychopathy
that's come down to affect us all.
09:53 Hare said, "You know what?
Forget about some guy at Broadmoor
09:55 who may or may not have faked madness.
09:57 Who cares? That's not a big story.
09:59 The big story," he said,
"is corporate psychopathy.
10:02 You want to go and interview yourself
some corporate psychopaths."
10:06 So I gave it a try.
I wrote to the Enron people.
10:09 I said, "Could I come
and interview you in prison,
10:12 to find out it you're psychopaths?"
10:14 (Laughter)
10:15 And they didn't reply.
10:16 (Laughter)
10:18 So I changed tack.
10:20 I emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap,
10:23 the asset stripper from the 1990s.
10:26 He would come into failing businesses
10:29 and close down 30 percent
of the workforce,
10:31 just turn American towns into ghost towns.
10:34 And I emailed him and I said,
10:35 "I believe you may have
a very special brain anomaly
10:38 that makes you ... special,
10:40 and interested in the predatory
spirit, and fearless.
10:45 Can I come and interview you
about your special brain anomaly?"
10:48 And he said, "Come on over!"
10:50 (Laughter)
10:51 So I went to Al Dunlap's
grand Florida mansion.
10:54 It was filled with sculptures
of predatory animals.
10:60 There were lions and tigers --
he was taking me through the garden --
11:03 there were falcons and eagles,
11:06 he was saying, "Over there
you've got sharks and --"
11:08 he was saying this
in a less effeminate way --
11:11 "You've got more sharks
and you've got tigers."
11:16 It was like Narnia.
11:18 (Laughter)
11:22 And then we went into his kitchen.
11:24 Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in
to save failing companies,
11:28 he'd close down 30 percent
of the workforce.
11:31 And he'd quite often
fire people with a joke.
11:34 Like, for instance,
one famous story about him,
11:36 somebody came up to him and said,
"I've just bought myself a new car."
11:40 And he said, "Well,
you may have a new car,
11:42 but I'll tell you what you
don't have -- a job."
11:47 So in his kitchen --
11:48 he was in there with his wife, Judy,
and his bodyguard, Sean --
11:51 and I said, "You know
how I said in my email
11:53 that you might have a special brain
anomaly that makes you special?"
11:57 He said, "Yeah, it's an amazing
theory, it's like Star Trek.
11:60 You're going where
no man has gone before."
12:02 And I said, "Well --" (Clears throat)
12:05 (Laughter)
12:06 Some psychologists might say
12:10 that this makes you --"
(Mumbles)
12:12 (Laughter)
12:14 And he said, "What?"
12:16 And I said, "A psychopath."
12:17 And I said, "I've got a list
of psychopathic traits in my pocket.
12:22 Can I go through them with you?"
12:25 And he looked intrigued despite himself,
12:27 and he said, "Okay, go on."
12:28 And I said, "Okay.
Grandiose sense of self-worth."
12:32 Which I have to say, would
have been hard for him to deny,
12:34 because he was standing
under a giant oil painting of himself.
12:38 (Laughter)
12:42 He said, "Well, you've
got to believe in you!"
12:45 And I said, "Manipulative."
12:48 He said, "That's leadership."
12:50 (Laughter)
12:51 And I said, "Shallow affect,
12:53 an inability to experience
a range of emotions."
12:55 He said, "Who wants to be weighed
down by some nonsense emotions?"
12:59 So he was going down
the psychopath checklist,
13:01 basically turning it
into "Who Moved My Cheese?"
13:04 (Laughter)
13:08 But I did notice something happening
to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.
13:11 Whenever he said anything to me
that was kind of normal --
13:14 like he said "no" to juvenile delinquency,
13:17 he said he got accepted into West Point,
13:19 and they don't let
delinquents in West Point.
13:22 He said "no" to many short-term
marital relationships.
13:24 He's only ever been married twice.
13:26 Admittedly, his first wife
cited in her divorce papers
13:29 that he once threatened her with a knife
13:32 and said he always wondered
what human flesh tasted like,
13:34 but people say stupid things to each other
13:36 in bad marriages
in the heat of an argument,
13:38 and his second marriage
has lasted 41 years.
13:41 So whenever he said anything to me
that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,
13:45 I thought to myself, well I'm not
going to put that in my book.
13:49 And then I realized that
becoming a psychopath spotter
13:52 had kind of turned me
a little bit psychopathic.
13:56 Because I was desperate to shove him
in a box marked "Psychopath."
14:01 I was desperate to define him
by his maddest edges.
14:05 And I realized, my God --
14:07 this is what I've been doing for 20 years.
14:09 It's what all journalists do.
14:10 We travel across the world
with our notepads in our hands,
14:14 and we wait for the gems.
14:16 And the gems are always
the outermost aspects
14:21 of our interviewee's personality.
14:22 And we stitch them together
like medieval monks,
14:26 and we leave the normal
stuff on the floor.
14:30 And you know, this is a country
that over-diagnoses
14:33 certain mental disorders hugely.
14:37 Childhood bipolar --
14:38 children as young as four
are being labeled bipolar
14:41 because they have temper tantrums,
14:44 which scores them high
on the bipolar checklist.
14:49 When I got back to London, Tony phoned me.
14:53 He said, "Why haven't you
been returning my calls?"
14:55 I said, "Well, they say
that you're a psychopath."
14:59 And he said, "I'm not a psychopath."
15:01 He said, "You know what?
15:02 One of the items on the checklist
is lack of remorse,
15:05 but another item on the checklist
is cunning, manipulative.
15:08 So when you say you feel
remorse for your crime,
15:10 they say, 'Typical of the psychopath
15:12 to cunningly say he feels
remorse when he doesn't.'
15:15 It's like witchcraft, they turn
everything upside-down."
15:20 He said, "I've got a tribunal coming up.
15:22 Will you come to it?"
15:24 So I said okay.
15:26 So I went to his tribunal.
15:28 And after 14 years
in Broadmoor, they let him go.
15:33 They decided that he shouldn't
be held indefinitely
15:36 because he scores high
on a checklist that might mean
15:40 that he would have a greater
than average chance of recidivism.
15:45 So they let him go.
15:46 And outside in the corridor he said to me,
15:48 "You know what, Jon?
15:50 Everyone's a bit psychopathic."
15:53 He said, "You are, I am.
Well, obviously I am."
15:57 I said, "What are you going to do now?"
15:59 He said, "I'm going to go to Belgium.
16:02 There's a woman there that I fancy.
16:03 But she's married, so I'm going to have
to get her split up from her husband."
16:07 (Laughter)
16:11 Anyway, that was two years ago,
16:14 and that's where my book ended.
16:16 And for the last 20 months,
everything was fine.
16:21 Nothing bad happened.
16:23 He was living with a girl outside London.
16:25 He was, according
to Brian the Scientologist,
16:27 making up for lost time,
which I know sounds ominous,
16:30 but isn't necessarily ominous.
16:32 Unfortunately, after 20 months,
16:34 he did go back to jail for a month.
16:37 He got into a "fracas"
in a bar, he called it.
16:41 Ended up going to jail for a month,
which I know is bad,
16:44 but at least a month implies
that whatever the fracas was,
16:48 it wasn't too bad.
16:50 And then he phoned me.
16:53 And you know what, I think
it's right that Tony is out.
16:58 Because you shouldn't define
people by their maddest edges.
17:01 And what Tony is,
is he's a semi-psychopath.
17:06 He's a gray area in a world
that doesn't like gray areas.
17:11 But the gray areas
are where you find the complexity.
17:16 It's where you find the humanity,
17:18 and it's where you find the truth.
17:21 And Tony said to me,
17:24 "Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?
17:27 I just want to thank you
for everything you've done for me."
17:31 And I didn't go.
17:33 What would you have done?
17:36 Thank you.
17:37 (Applause)
