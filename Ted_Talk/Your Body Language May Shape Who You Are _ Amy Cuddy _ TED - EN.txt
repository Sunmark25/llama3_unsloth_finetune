00:16 So I want to start by offering you
a free no-tech life hack,
00:21 and all it requires of you is this:
00:24 that you change your posture
for two minutes.
00:28 But before I give it away,
I want to ask you to right now
00:32 do a little audit of your body
and what you're doing with your body.
00:35 So how many of you are
sort of making yourselves smaller?
00:38 Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,
maybe wrapping your ankles.
00:41 Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
00:45 Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)
00:49 I see you.
00:51 So I want you to pay attention
to what you're doing right now.
00:54 We're going to come back
to that in a few minutes,
00:56 and I'm hoping that if you learn
to tweak this a little bit,
00:59 it could significantly change
the way your life unfolds.
01:03 So, we're really fascinated
with body language,
01:07 and we're particularly interested
in other people's body language.
01:11 You know, we're interested in,
like, you know — (Laughter) —
01:15 an awkward interaction, or a smile,
01:20 or a contemptuous glance,
or maybe a very awkward wink,
01:24 or maybe even something like a handshake.
01:27 Narrator: Here they are
arriving at Number 10.
01:31 This lucky policeman gets to shake hands
with the President of the United States.
01:35 Here comes the Prime Minister --
No. (Laughter) (Applause)
01:40 (Laughter) (Applause)
01:43 Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,
or the lack of a handshake,
01:46 can have us talking for weeks
and weeks and weeks.
01:49 Even the BBC and The New York Times.
01:51 So obviously when we think
about nonverbal behavior,
01:55 or body language -- but we call it
nonverbals as social scientists --
01:58 it's language, so we think
about communication.
02:01 When we think about communication,
we think about interactions.
02:04 So what is your body language
communicating to me?
02:07 What's mine communicating to you?
02:09 And there's a lot of reason to believe
that this is a valid way to look at this.
02:15 So social scientists
have spent a lot of time
02:17 looking at the effects
of our body language,
02:19 or other people's body language,
on judgments.
02:21 And we make sweeping judgments
and inferences from body language.
02:25 And those judgments can predict
really meaningful life outcomes
02:29 like who we hire or promote,
who we ask out on a date.
02:33 For example, Nalini Ambady,
a researcher at Tufts University,
02:37 shows that when people watch
30-second soundless clips
02:42 of real physician-patient interactions,
02:45 their judgments
of the physician's niceness
02:48 predict whether or not
that physician will be sued.
02:50 So it doesn't have to do so much
02:52 with whether or not that physician
was incompetent,
02:55 but do we like that person
and how they interacted?
02:57 Even more dramatic,
Alex Todorov at Princeton
03:00 has shown us that judgments
of political candidates' faces
03:04 in just one second predict 70 percent
03:08 of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial
race outcomes,
03:12 and even, let's go digital,
03:14 emoticons used well in online negotiations
03:18 can lead you to claim more value
from that negotiation.
03:21 If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
03:24 So when we think of nonverbals,
we think of how we judge others,
03:27 how they judge us
and what the outcomes are.
03:30 We tend to forget, though,
the other audience
03:32 that's influenced by our nonverbals,
and that's ourselves.
03:36 We are also influenced by our nonverbals,
03:39 our thoughts and our feelings
and our physiology.
03:41 So what nonverbals am I talking about?
03:44 I'm a social psychologist.
I study prejudice,
03:47 and I teach at a competitive
business school,
03:50 so it was inevitable that I would become
interested in power dynamics.
03:55 I became especially interested
in nonverbal expressions
03:58 of power and dominance.
04:00 And what are nonverbal expressions
of power and dominance?
04:03 Well, this is what they are.
04:05 So in the animal kingdom,
they are about expanding.
04:08 So you make yourself big, you stretch out,
04:11 you take up space,
you're basically opening up.
04:14 It's about opening up.
04:16 And this is true
across the animal kingdom.
04:19 It's not just limited to primates.
04:22 And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)
04:24 So they do this both when they have
power sort of chronically,
04:28 and also when they're feeling
powerful in the moment.
04:31 And this one is especially interesting
because it really shows us
04:34 how universal and old these
expressions of power are.
04:38 This expression, which is known as pride,
04:41 Jessica Tracy has studied.
04:43 She shows that people
who are born with sight
04:46 and people who are congenitally
blind do this
04:49 when they win at a physical competition.
04:51 So when they cross
the finish line and they've won,
04:54 it doesn't matter if they've never
seen anyone do it.
04:56 They do this.
04:57 So the arms up in the V,
the chin is slightly lifted.
04:60 What do we do when we feel powerless?
05:02 We do exactly the opposite.
05:04 We close up.
We wrap ourselves up.
05:06 We make ourselves small.
05:08 We don't want to bump
into the person next to us.
05:10 So again, both animals and humans
do the same thing.
05:13 And this is what happens
when you put together high and low power.
05:17 So what we tend to
do when it comes to power
05:20 is that we complement
the other's nonverbals.
05:23 So if someone is being
really powerful with us,
05:25 we tend to make ourselves smaller.
We don't mirror them.
05:28 We do the opposite of them.
05:29 So I'm watching this behavior
in the classroom,
05:32 and what do I notice?
05:35 I notice that MBA students really exhibit
the full range of power nonverbals.
05:42 So you have people
who are like caricatures of alphas,
05:45 really coming into the room, they get
right into the middle of the room
05:48 before class even starts,
like they really want to occupy space.
05:52 When they sit down,
they're sort of spread out.
05:54 They raise their hands like this.
05:56 You have other people
who are virtually collapsing
05:58 when they come in.
As soon they come in, you see it.
06:01 You see it on their faces
and their bodies,
06:03 and they sit in their chair
and they make themselves tiny,
06:06 and they go like this
when they raise their hand.
06:08 I notice a couple of things about this.
06:10 One, you're not going to be surprised.
06:12 It seems to be related to gender.
06:14 So women are much more likely
to do this kind of thing than men.
06:19 Women feel chronically
less powerful than men,
06:22 so this is not surprising.
06:24 But the other thing I noticed
06:26 is that it also seemed
to be related to the extent
06:29 to which the students were participating,
and how well they were participating.
06:33 And this is really important
in the MBA classroom,
06:35 because participation
counts for half the grade.
06:38 So business schools have been struggling
with this gender grade gap.
06:42 You get these equally qualified
women and men coming in
06:46 and then you get
these differences in grades,
06:48 and it seems to be partly
attributable to participation.
06:51 So I started to wonder, you know, okay,
06:54 so you have these people coming in
like this, and they're participating.
06:57 Is it possible that we could
get people to fake it
07:00 and would it lead them
to participate more?
07:02 So my main collaborator
Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,
07:07 and I really wanted to know,
can you fake it till you make it?
07:10 Like, can you do this
just for a little while
07:13 and actually experience
a behavioral outcome
07:15 that makes you seem more powerful?
07:17 So we know that our nonverbals
govern how other people
07:21 think and feel about us.
There's a lot of evidence.
07:23 But our question really was,
07:24 do our nonverbals govern
how we think and feel about ourselves?
07:29 There's some evidence that they do.
07:31 So, for example, we smile
when we feel happy,
07:36 but also, when we're forced to smile
07:38 by holding a pen in our teeth
like this, it makes us feel happy.
07:42 So it goes both ways.
07:44 When it comes to power,
it also goes both ways.
07:48 So when you feel powerful,
07:51 you're more likely to do this,
07:53 but it's also possible
that when you pretend to be powerful,
07:59 you are more likely
to actually feel powerful.
08:02 So the second question
really was, you know,
08:05 so we know that our minds
change our bodies,
08:08 but is it also true
that our bodies change our minds?
08:12 And when I say minds,
in the case of the powerful,
08:15 what am I talking about?
08:16 So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings
08:18 and the sort of physiological things
that make up our thoughts and feelings,
08:22 and in my case, that's hormones.
I look at hormones.
08:25 So what do the minds of the powerful
versus the powerless look like?
08:29 So powerful people tend to be,
not surprisingly,
08:34 more assertive and more confident,
more optimistic.
08:38 They actually feel they're going to win
even at games of chance.
08:41 They also tend to be able
to think more abstractly.
08:45 So there are a lot of differences.
They take more risks.
08:48 There are a lot of differences
between powerful and powerless people.
08:51 Physiologically,
there also are differences
08:54 on two key hormones: testosterone,
which is the dominance hormone,
08:58 and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.
09:02 So what we find is that high-power
alpha males in primate hierarchies
09:09 have high testosterone and low cortisol,
09:12 and powerful and effective leaders
09:16 also have high testosterone
and low cortisol.
09:18 So what does that mean?
When you think about power,
09:20 people tended to think
only about testosterone,
09:23 because that was about dominance.
09:24 But really, power is also about
how you react to stress.
09:28 So do you want the high-power
leader that's dominant,
09:31 high on testosterone,
but really stress reactive?
09:34 Probably not, right?
09:35 You want the person who's powerful
and assertive and dominant,
09:38 but not very stress reactive,
the person who's laid back.
09:42 So we know that in primate hierarchies,
09:47 if an alpha needs to take over,
09:50 if an individual needs to take over
an alpha role sort of suddenly,
09:54 within a few days,
that individual's testosterone has gone up
09:58 significantly and his cortisol
has dropped significantly.
10:01 So we have this evidence,
both that the body can shape
10:04 the mind, at least at the facial level,
10:06 and also that role changes
can shape the mind.
10:11 So what happens, okay,
you take a role change,
10:13 what happens if you do that
at a really minimal level,
10:16 like this tiny manipulation,
this tiny intervention?
10:18 "For two minutes," you say,
"I want you to stand like this,
10:21 and it's going to make you feel
more powerful."
10:24 So this is what we did.
10:27 We decided to bring people into the lab
and run a little experiment,
10:31 and these people adopted, for two minutes,
10:35 either high-power poses
or low-power poses,
10:38 and I'm just going to show
you five of the poses,
10:41 although they took on only two.
10:42 So here's one.
10:45 A couple more.
10:47 This one has been dubbed
the "Wonder Woman" by the media.
10:52 Here are a couple more.
10:53 So you can be standing
or you can be sitting.
10:56 And here are the low-power poses.
10:58 So you're folding up,
you're making yourself small.
11:02 This one is very low-power.
11:03 When you're touching your neck,
you're really protecting yourself.
11:07 So this is what happens.
11:09 They come in, they spit into a vial,
11:12 for two minutes, we say,
"You need to do this or this."
11:15 They don't look at pictures of the poses.
11:17 We don't want to prime them
with a concept of power.
11:19 We want them to be feeling power.
11:21 So two minutes they do this.
11:23 We then ask them, "How powerful
do you feel?" on a series of items,
11:26 and then we give them
an opportunity to gamble,
11:28 and then we take another saliva sample.
11:31 That's it. That's the whole experiment.
11:33 So this is what we find.
11:34 Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,
11:36 we find that when you are
in the high-power pose condition,
11:40 86 percent of you will gamble.
11:43 When you're in the low-power
pose condition,
11:45 only 60 percent, and that's
a whopping significant difference.
11:49 Here's what we find on testosterone.
11:51 From their baseline when they come in,
11:54 high-power people experience
about a 20-percent increase,
11:57 and low-power people experience
about a 10-percent decrease.
12:02 So again, two minutes,
and you get these changes.
12:04 Here's what you get on cortisol.
12:06 High-power people experience
about a 25-percent decrease,
12:10 and the low-power people experience
about a 15-percent increase.
12:14 So two minutes lead
to these hormonal changes
12:17 that configure your brain
12:19 to basically be either assertive,
confident and comfortable,
12:23 or really stress-reactive,
and feeling sort of shut down.
12:28 And we've all had the feeling, right?
12:31 So it seems that our nonverbals do govern
how we think and feel about ourselves,
12:36 so it's not just others,
but it's also ourselves.
12:39 Also, our bodies change our minds.
12:41 But the next question, of course,
12:43 is, can power posing for a few minutes
12:45 really change your life
in meaningful ways?
12:47 This is in the lab, it's this little task,
it's just a couple of minutes.
12:52 Where can you actually apply this?
12:53 Which we cared about, of course.
12:55 And so we think where you want to use this
is evaluative situations,
13:02 like social threat situations.
13:04 Where are you being evaluated,
either by your friends?
13:07 For teenagers,
it's at the lunchroom table.
13:09 For some people it's speaking
at a school board meeting.
13:13 It might be giving a pitch
or giving a talk like this
13:17 or doing a job interview.
13:20 We decided that the one
that most people could relate to
13:23 because most people had been through,
was the job interview.
13:26 So we published these findings,
13:28 and the media are all over it,
13:30 and they say, Okay, so this is what you do
13:32 when you go in
for the job interview, right?
13:34 (Laughter)
13:35 You know, so we were of course
horrified, and said,
13:38 Oh my God, no,
that's not what we meant at all.
13:40 For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.
13:42 Again, this is not about you
talking to other people.
13:45 It's you talking to yourself.
13:46 What do you do before you go
into a job interview? You do this.
13:49 You're sitting down.
You're looking at your iPhone --
13:52 or your Android, not trying
to leave anyone out.
13:54 You're looking at your notes,
13:56 you're hunching up, making yourself small,
13:58 when really what you should
be doing maybe is this,
14:01 like, in the bathroom, right?
Do that. Find two minutes.
14:04 So that's what we want to test. Okay?
14:06 So we bring people into a lab,
14:07 and they do either high-
or low-power poses again,
14:11 they go through
a very stressful job interview.
14:13 It's five minutes long.
They are being recorded.
14:17 They're being judged also,
14:19 and the judges are trained
to give no nonverbal feedback,
14:23 so they look like this.
14:25 Imagine this is the person
interviewing you.
14:27 So for five minutes, nothing,
and this is worse than being heckled.
14:32 People hate this.
14:34 It's what Marianne LaFrance calls
"standing in social quicksand."
14:37 So this really spikes your cortisol.
14:39 So this is the job interview
we put them through,
14:41 because we really wanted
to see what happened.
14:44 We then have these coders look
at these tapes, four of them.
14:47 They're blind to the hypothesis.
They're blind to the conditions.
14:50 They have no idea
who's been posing in what pose,
14:53 and they end up looking
at these sets of tapes,
14:58 and they say,
"We want to hire these people,"
15:00 all the high-power posers.
15:02 "We don't want to hire these people.
15:03 We also evaluate these people
much more positively overall."
15:07 But what's driving it?
15:09 It's not about the content of the speech.
15:11 It's about the presence
that they're bringing to the speech.
15:14 Because we rate them
on all these variables
15:16 related to competence,
like, how well-structured is the speech?
15:20 How good is it?
What are their qualifications?
15:22 No effect on those things.
This is what's affected.
15:25 These kinds of things.
15:26 People are bringing
their true selves, basically.
15:29 They're bringing themselves.
15:30 They bring their ideas, but as themselves,
15:32 with no, you know, residue over them.
15:35 So this is what's driving the effect,
or mediating the effect.
15:40 So when I tell people about this,
15:43 that our bodies change our minds
and our minds can change our behavior,
15:46 and our behavior can change
our outcomes, they say to me,
15:49 "It feels fake." Right?
15:51 So I said, fake it till you make it.
15:53 It's not me.
15:54 I don't want to get there
and then still feel like a fraud.
15:58 I don't want to feel like an impostor.
15:59 I don't want to get there only to feel
like I'm not supposed to be here.
16:04 And that really resonated with me,
16:06 because I want to tell you
a little story about being an impostor
16:09 and feeling like
I'm not supposed to be here.
16:11 When I was 19, I was
in a really bad car accident.
16:14 I was thrown out of a car,
rolled several times.
16:18 I was thrown from the car.
16:19 And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,
16:22 and I had been withdrawn from college,
16:25 and I learned that my IQ had dropped
by two standard deviations,
16:30 which was very traumatic.
16:33 I knew my IQ because
I had identified with being smart,
16:36 and I had been called gifted as a child.
16:38 So I'm taken out of college,
I keep trying to go back.
16:41 They say, "You're not going
to finish college.
16:43 Just, you know, there are other
things for you to do,
16:46 but that's not going to work out for you."
16:48 So I really struggled
with this, and I have to say,
16:51 having your identity taken
from you, your core identity,
16:54 and for me it was being smart,
16:56 having that taken from you,
16:58 there's nothing that leaves you feeling
more powerless than that.
17:01 So I felt entirely powerless.
17:03 I worked and worked, and I got lucky,
17:05 and worked, and got lucky, and worked.
17:06 Eventually I graduated from college.
17:09 It took me four years
longer than my peers,
17:11 and I convinced someone,
my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,
17:15 to take me on,
and so I ended up at Princeton,
17:18 and I was like,
I am not supposed to be here.
17:21 I am an impostor.
17:22 And the night before my first-year talk,
17:24 and the first-year talk at Princeton
is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.
17:28 That's it.
17:29 I was so afraid of being
found out the next day
17:31 that I called her
and said, "I'm quitting."
17:34 She was like, "You are not quitting,
17:36 because I took a gamble
on you, and you're staying.
17:38 You're going to stay, and this is
what you're going to do.
17:41 You are going to fake it.
17:43 You're going to do every talk
that you ever get asked to do.
17:46 You're just going to do it
and do it and do it,
17:48 even if you're terrified
and just paralyzed
17:51 and having an out-of-body experience,
17:53 until you have this moment where you say,
'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.
17:56 Like, I have become this.
I am actually doing this.'"
17:59 So that's what I did.
18:00 Five years in grad school,
18:02 a few years, you know,
I'm at Northwestern,
18:04 I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,
18:06 I'm not really thinking about it anymore,
but for a long time I had been thinking,
18:10 "Not supposed to be here."
18:12 So at the end of my first year at Harvard,
18:14 a student who had not talked
in class the entire semester,
18:19 who I had said, "Look, you've gotta
participate or else you're going to fail,"
18:22 came into my office.
I really didn't know her at all.
18:25 She came in totally defeated,
and she said,
18:28 "I'm not supposed to be here."
18:35 And that was the moment for me.
18:37 Because two things happened.
18:39 One was that I realized,
18:40 oh my gosh,
I don't feel like that anymore.
18:43 I don't feel that anymore,
but she does, and I get that feeling.
18:46 And the second was,
she is supposed to be here!
18:49 Like, she can fake it, she can become it.
18:51 So I was like, "Yes, you are!
You are supposed to be here!
18:54 And tomorrow you're going to fake it,
18:56 you're going to make yourself
powerful, and, you know --
18:59 (Applause)
19:04 And you're going to go
into the classroom,
19:08 and you are going to give
the best comment ever."
19:11 You know? And she gave
the best comment ever,
19:14 and people turned around and were like,
19:16 oh my God, I didn't even notice her
sitting there. (Laughter)
19:19 She comes back to me months later,
19:20 and I realized that she had not just
faked it till she made it,
19:23 she had actually faked it
till she became it.
19:26 So she had changed.
19:28 And so I want to say to you,
don't fake it till you make it.
19:32 Fake it till you become it.
19:35 Do it enough until you actually
become it and internalize.
19:38 The last thing I'm going
to leave you with is this.
19:41 Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.
19:45 So, this is two minutes.
19:48 Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
19:50 Before you go into the next stressful
evaluative situation,
19:53 for two minutes, try doing this,
in the elevator,
19:56 in a bathroom stall, at your desk
behind closed doors.
19:59 That's what you want to do.
20:00 Configure your brain
to cope the best in that situation.
20:03 Get your testosterone up.
Get your cortisol down.
20:06 Don't leave that situation feeling
like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.
20:10 Leave that situation feeling like,
20:12 I really feel like I got to say
who I am and show who I am.
20:15 So I want to ask you first, you know,
both to try power posing,
20:20 and also I want to ask you to share
the science, because this is simple.
20:26 I don't have ego involved in this.
(Laughter)
20:28 Give it away. Share it with people,
20:30 because the people who can use it the most
20:32 are the ones with no resources
and no technology
20:35 and no status and no power.
20:38 Give it to them
because they can do it in private.
20:40 They need their bodies,
privacy and two minutes,
20:43 and it can significantly change
the outcomes of their life.
20:46 Thank you.
20:47 (Applause)
