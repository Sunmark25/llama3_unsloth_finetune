00:13 I have a confession to make.
00:17 But first, I want you to make a little confession to me.
00:24 In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand
00:27 if you've experienced relatively little stress.
00:30 Anyone?
00:33 How about a moderate amount of stress?
00:36 Who has experienced a lot of stress?
00:38 Yeah. Me too.
00:41 But that is not my confession.
00:43 My confession is this:
00:45 I am a health psychologist,
00:47 and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier.
00:52 But I fear that something I've been teaching
00:55 for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good,
00:59 and it has to do with stress.
01:02 For years I've been telling people, stress makes you sick.
01:05 It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease.
01:10 Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy.
01:14 But I have changed my mind about stress,
01:17 and today, I want to change yours.
01:21 Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress.
01:26 This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years,
01:31 and they started by asking people,
01:33 "How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"
01:37 They also asked,
01:39 "Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?"
01:44 And then they used public death records to find out who died.
01:49 Okay.
01:51 Some bad news first.
01:53 People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.
02:01 But that was only true for the people
02:04 who also believed that stress is harmful for your health.
02:11 People who experienced a lot of stress
02:13 but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die.
02:17 In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study,
02:22 including people who had relatively little stress.
02:25 Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years
02:28 they were tracking deaths,
02:29 182,000 Americans died prematurely,
02:32 not from stress,
02:34 but from the belief that stress is bad for you.
02:38 That is over 20,000 deaths a year.
02:42 Now, if that estimate is correct,
02:45 that would makebelieving stress is bad for you
02:47 the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year,
02:51 killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide.
02:59 You can see why this study freaked me out.
03:02 Here I've been spending so much energy telling people
03:06 stress is bad for your health.
03:09 So this study got me wondering:
03:11 Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier?
03:15 And here the science says yes.
03:17 When you change your mind about stress,
03:19 you can change your body's response to stress.
03:22 Now to explain how this works,
03:24 I want you all to pretend that you are participants
03:27 in a study designed to stress you out.
03:30 It's called the social stress test.
03:33 You come into the laboratory,
03:35 and you're told you have to give
03:37 a five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses
03:41 to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you,
03:45 and to make sure you feel the pressure,
03:47 there are bright lights and a camera in your face,
03:50 kind of like this.
03:52 And the evaluators have been trained
03:55 to give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback,
03:59 like this.
04:09 Now that you're sufficiently demoralized,
04:11 time for part two: a math test.
04:14 And unbeknownst to you,
04:16 the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it.
04:20 Now we're going to all do this together.
04:23 It's going to be fun.
04:24 For me.
04:25 Okay.
04:28 I want you all to count backwards from 996
04:32 in increments of seven.
04:33 You're going to do this out loud,
04:35 as fast as you can,
04:37 starting with 996.
04:39 Go!
04:41 Go faster. Faster please.
04:44 You're going too slow.
04:47 Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
04:48 That guy made a mistake.
04:50 We are going to have to start all over again.
04:53 You're not very good at this, are you?
04:55 Okay, so you get the idea.
04:57 If you were actually in this study,
04:58 you'd probably be a little stressed out.
05:00 Your heart might be pounding,
05:02 you might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat.
05:05 And normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety
05:10 or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure.
05:13 But what if you viewed them instead
05:15 as signs that your body was energized,
05:17 was preparing you to meet this challenge?
05:21 Now that is exactly what participants were told
05:24 in a study conducted at Harvard University.
05:27 Before they went through the social stress test,
05:29 they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.
05:33 That pounding heart is preparing you for action.
05:36 If you're breathing faster, it's no problem.
05:39 It's getting more oxygen to your brain.
05:42 And participants who learned to view the stress response
05:45 as helpful for their performance,
05:47 well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident,
05:50 but the most fascinating finding to me
05:52 was how their physical stress response changed.
05:56 Now, in a typical stress response,
05:58 your heart rate goes up,
05:59 and your blood vessels constrict like this.
06:04 And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress
06:07 is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease.
06:10 It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.
06:14 But in the study,
06:15 when participants viewed their stress response as helpful,
06:18 their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this.
06:21 Their heart was still pounding,
06:23 but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile.
06:26 It actually looks a lot like what happens
06:28 in moments of joy and courage.
06:33 Over a lifetime of stressful experiences,
06:36 this one biological change
06:39 could be the difference
06:40 between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50
06:43 and living well into your 90s.
06:46 And this is really what the new science of stress reveals,
06:49 that how you think about stress matters.
06:53 So my goal as a health psychologist has changed.
06:56 I no longer want to get rid of your stress.
06:58 I want to make you better at stress.
07:01 And we just did a little intervention.
07:04 If you raised your hand and said
07:05 you'd had a lot of stress in the last year,
07:08 we could have saved your life,
07:09 because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress,
07:13 you're going to remember this talk
07:15 and you're going to think to yourself,
07:17 this is my body helping me rise to this challenge.
07:22 And when you view stress in that way,
07:24 your body believes you,
07:27 and your stress response becomes healthier.
07:30 Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress
07:34 to redeem myself from,
07:36 so we are going to do one more intervention.
07:39 I want to tell you
07:40 about one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the stress response,
07:44 and the idea is this:
07:46 Stress makes you social.
07:49 To understand this side of stress,
07:51 we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,
07:54 and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get.
07:59 It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone,
08:02 because it's released when you hug someone.
08:05 But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in.
08:10 Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.
08:12 It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts.
08:16 It primes you to do things
08:18 that strengthen close relationships.
08:21 Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family.
08:26 It enhances your empathy.
08:28 It even makes you more willing to help and support
08:31 the people you care about.
08:34 Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin...
08:39 to become more compassionate and caring.
08:43 But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.
08:48 It's a stress hormone.
08:51 Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out
08:54 as part of the stress response.
08:56 It's as much a part of your stress response
08:58 as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound.
09:02 And when oxytocin is released in the stress response,
09:05 it is motivating you to seek support.
09:08 Your biological stress response
09:10 is nudging you to tell someone how you feel,
09:14 instead of bottling it up.
09:16 Your stress response wants to make sure you notice
09:19 when someone else in your life is struggling
09:22 so that you can support each other.
09:24 When life is difficult,
09:26 your stress response wants you to be surrounded
09:31 by people who care about you.
09:33 Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier?
09:38 Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.
09:40 It also acts on your body,
09:43 and one of its main roles in your body
09:45 is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress.
09:50 It's a natural anti-inflammatory.
09:53 It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.
09:56 But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart.
09:59 Your heart has receptors for this hormone,
10:03 and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate
10:07 and heal from any stress-induced damage.
10:11 This stress hormone strengthens your heart.
10:16 And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits
10:19 of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support.
10:24 So when you reach out to others under stress,
10:27 either to seek support or to help someone else,
10:30 you release more of this hormone,
10:32 your stress response becomes healthier,
10:34 and you actually recover faster from stress.
10:38 I find this amazing,
10:40 that your stress response has a built-in mechanism
10:44 for stress resilience,
10:47 and that mechanism is human connection.
10:51 I want to finish by telling you about one more study.
10:54 And listen up, because this study could also save a life.
10:59 This study tracked about 1,000 adults in the United States,
11:02 and they ranged in age from 34 to 93,
11:06 and they started the study by asking,
11:08 "How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"
11:13 They also asked,
11:14 "How much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors,
11:19 people in your community?"
11:22 And then they used public records for the next five years
11:25 to find out who died.
11:28 Okay, so the bad news first:
11:30 For every major stressful life experience,
11:33 like financial difficulties or family crisis,
11:36 that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent.
11:40 But -- and I hope you are expecting a "but" by now --
11:44 but that wasn't true for everyone.
11:47 People who spent time caring for others
11:51 showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying.
11:55 Zero.
11:57 Caring created resilience.
12:00 And so we see once again
12:02 that the harmful effects of stress on your health
12:04 are not inevitable.
12:07 How you think and how you act
12:09 can transform your experience of stress.
12:13 When you choose to view your stress response as helpful,
12:18 you create the biology of courage.
12:23 And when you choose to connect with others under stress,
12:26 you can create resilience.
12:30 Now I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life,
12:35 but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress.
12:41 Stress gives us access to our hearts.
12:46 The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning
12:50 in connecting with others,
12:51 and yes, your pounding physical heart,
12:55 working so hard to give you strength and energy.
12:60 And when you choose to view stress in this way,
13:03 you're not just getting better at stress,
13:06 you're actually making a pretty profound statement.
13:10 You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges.
13:16 And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone.
13:22 Thank you.
13:32 Chris Anderson: This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us.
13:35 It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress
13:39 can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy.
13:44 How would that extend to advice,
13:46 like, if someone is making a lifestyle choice
13:48 between, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job,
13:52 does it matter which way they go?
13:54 It's equally wise to go for the stressful job
13:57 so long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense?
13:60 KM: Yeah, and one thing we know for certain
14:02 is that chasing meaning is better for your health
14:05 than trying to avoid discomfort.
14:06 And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions,
14:09 is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life
14:12 and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.
14:16 CA: Thank you so much, Kelly. It's pretty cool.
