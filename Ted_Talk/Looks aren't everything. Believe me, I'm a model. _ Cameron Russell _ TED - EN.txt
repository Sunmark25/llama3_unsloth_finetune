00:16 Hi. My name is Cameron Russell,
00:18 and for the last little while,
I've been a model.
00:24 Actually, for 10 years.
00:28 And I feel like
00:30 there's an uncomfortable tension
in the room right now
00:33 because I should not have worn this dress.
00:35 (Laughter)
00:37 So luckily, I brought an outfit change.
00:40 This is the first outfit change
on the TED stage,
00:43 so you guys are pretty lucky
to witness it, I think.
00:46 If some of the women were
really horrified when I came out,
00:49 you don't have to tell me now,
but I'll find out later on Twitter.
00:52 (Laughter)
00:58 I'd also note that I'm quite privileged
00:59 to be able to transform
what you think of me
01:03 in a very brief 10 seconds.
01:05 Not everybody gets to do that.
01:09 These heels are very uncomfortable,
so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.
01:14 The worst part is putting
this sweater over my head,
01:17 because that's when
you'll all laugh at me,
01:19 so don't do anything
while it's over my head.
01:23 All right.
01:26 So, why did I do that?
01:29 That was awkward.
01:30 (Laughter)
01:32 Well --
01:33 (Laughter)
01:36 Hopefully not as awkward as that picture.
01:41 Image is powerful,
01:43 but also, image is superficial.
01:48 I just totally transformed
what you thought of me, in six seconds.
01:53 And in this picture,
01:55 I had actually never had
a boyfriend in real life.
01:58 I was totally uncomfortable,
01:60 and the photographer
was telling me to arch my back
02:02 and put my hand in that guy's hair.
02:06 And of course, barring surgery,
02:08 or the fake tan that I got
two days ago for work,
02:12 there's very little that we can do
to transform how we look,
02:15 and how we look, though it is
superficial and immutable,
02:19 has a huge impact on our lives.
02:23 So today, for me, being
fearless means being honest.
02:28 And I am on this stage
because I am a model.
02:31 I am on this stage because
I am a pretty, white woman,
02:35 and in my industry,
we call that a sexy girl.
02:37 I'm going to answer the questions
that people always ask me,
02:40 but with an honest twist.
02:41 So the first question is,
how do you become a model?
02:44 I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted,"
02:46 but that means nothing.
02:48 The real way that I became a model
02:51 is I won a genetic lottery,
and I am the recipient of a legacy,
02:54 and maybe you're wondering
what is a legacy.
02:56 Well, for the past few centuries
02:59 we have defined beauty
not just as health and youth
03:05 and symmetry that we're biologically
programmed to admire,
03:08 but also as tall, slender figures,
03:12 and femininity and white skin.
03:15 And this is a legacy
that was built for me,
03:17 and it's a legacy
that I've been cashing out on.
03:20 And I know there are
people in the audience
03:22 who are skeptical at this point,
03:23 and maybe there are
some fashionistas who are like,
03:26 "Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."
03:29 And first, I commend you on your model
knowledge. Very impressive.
03:32 (Laughter)
03:33 But unfortunately,
I have to inform you that in 2007,
03:37 a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student
03:39 counted all the models on the runway,
every single one that was hired,
03:43 and of the 677 models that were hired,
03:46 only 27, or less than four percent,
were non-white.
03:51 The next question people always ask is,
03:53 "Can I be a model when I grow up?"
03:55 And the first answer is, "I don't know,
they don't put me in charge of that."
03:58 But the second answer,
03:60 and what I really want to say
to these little girls is,
04:02 "Why? You know? You can be anything.
04:04 You could be the President
of the United States,
04:07 or the inventor of the next Internet,
04:08 or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,
04:10 which would be awesome,
because you'd be the first one."
04:13 (Laughter)
04:15 If, after this amazing list,
they still are like,
04:18 "No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"
04:20 well, then I say, "Be my boss."
04:21 Because I'm not in charge of anything,
04:23 and you could be the editor in chief
of American Vogue
04:26 or the CEO of H&amp;M,
or the next Steven Meisel.
04:28 Saying that you want to be
a model when you grow up
04:31 is akin to saying that you want to win
the Powerball when you grow up.
04:34 It's out of your control,
and it's awesome,
04:37 and it's not a career path.
04:40 I will demonstrate for you now
10 years of accumulated model knowledge,
04:44 because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,
04:45 it can just be distilled right now.
04:48 So, if the photographer is right there,
04:51 the light is right there, like a nice HMI,
04:53 and the client says,
"We want a walking shot,"
04:56 this leg goes first, nice and long,
this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,
04:59 the head is at three quarters,
and you just go back and forth,
05:02 just do that, and then you look back
at your imaginary friends,
05:05 300, 400, 500 times.
05:07 (Laughter)
05:09 It will look something like this.
05:10 (Laughter)
05:13 Hopefully less awkward
than that one in the middle.
05:16 That was -- I don't know
what happened there.
05:18 Unfortunately,
after you've gone to school,
05:20 and you have a résumé
and you've done a few jobs,
05:23 you can't say anything anymore,
05:24 so if you say you want to be
the President of the United States,
05:27 but your résumé reads,
"Underwear Model: 10 years,"
05:30 people give you a funny look.
05:31 The next question is,
"Do they retouch all the photos?"
05:34 And yeah, they pretty much
retouch all the photos,
05:36 but that is only a small component
of what's happening.
05:39 This picture is the very first
picture that I ever took,
05:42 and it's also the very first time
that I had worn a bikini,
05:45 and I didn't even have my period yet.
05:47 I know we're getting personal,
but I was a young girl.
05:50 This is what I looked like with my grandma
just a few months earlier.
05:54 Here's me on the same day as this shoot.
05:56 My friend got to come.
05:58 Here's me at a slumber party
a few days before I shot French Vogue.
06:02 Here's me on the soccer team
and in V Magazine.
06:06 And here's me today.
06:08 And I hope what you're seeing
06:10 is that these pictures
are not pictures of me.
06:12 They are constructions,
06:13 and they are constructions
by a group of professionals,
06:16 by hairstylists and makeup artists
and photographers and stylists
06:19 and all of their assistants
and pre-production and post-production,
06:22 and they build this.
06:23 That's not me.
06:25 Okay, so the next question
people always ask me is,
06:27 "Do you get free stuff?"
06:28 (Laughter)
06:29 I do have too many 8-inch heels
which I never get to wear,
06:33 except for earlier,
06:34 but the free stuff that I get
is the free stuff that I get in real life,
06:38 and that's what we don't like
to talk about.
06:40 I grew up in Cambridge,
06:41 and one time I went into a store
and I forgot my money
06:44 and they gave me the dress for free.
06:46 When I was a teenager,
I was driving with my friend
06:49 who was an awful driver
and she ran a red and of course,
06:51 we got pulled over,
06:53 and all it took was a "Sorry, officer,"
and we were on our way.
06:58 And I got these free things
because of how I look,
07:01 not who I am, and there are
people paying a cost
07:04 for how they look and not who they are.
07:06 I live in New York, and last year,
07:08 of the 140,000 teenagers
that were stopped and frisked,
07:11 86% of them were black and Latino,
and most of them were young men.
07:15 And there are only 177,000
young black and Latino men in New York,
07:20 so for them, it's not a question
of, "Will I get stopped?"
07:23 but "How many times will I get stopped?
When will I get stopped?"
07:26 When I was researching this talk,
07:27 I found out that of the 13-year-old girls
in the United States,
07:30 53% don't like their bodies,
07:33 and that number goes to 78%
by the time that they're 17.
07:37 So, the last question people ask me is,
07:40 "What is it like to be a model?"
07:42 And I think the answer
that they're looking for is,
07:44 "If you are a little bit skinnier
and you have shinier hair,
07:47 you will be so happy and fabulous."
07:50 And when we're backstage,
07:51 we give an answer
that maybe makes it seem like that.
07:54 We say, "It's really amazing to travel,
and it's amazing to get to work
07:58 with creative, inspired,
passionate people."
08:00 And those things are true,
but they're only one half of the story,
08:03 because the thing
that we never say on camera,
08:06 that I have never said on camera, is,
08:08 "I am insecure."
08:10 And I'm insecure because I have to think
about what I look like every day.
08:16 And if you ever are wondering,
08:19 "If I have thinner thighs
and shinier hair, will I be happier?"
08:23 you just need to meet a group of models,
08:25 because they have the thinnest thighs,
the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,
08:29 and they're the most physically
insecure women probably on the planet.
08:32 When I was writing this talk,
08:34 I found it very difficult
to strike an honest balance,
08:37 because on the one hand,
08:38 I felt very uncomfortable
to come out here and say,
08:40 "Look I've received all these benefits
from a deck stacked in my favor,"
08:44 and it also felt really uncomfortable
to follow that up with,
08:47 "and it doesn't always make me happy."
08:50 But mostly it was difficult to unpack
a legacy of gender and racial oppression
08:56 when I am one
of the biggest beneficiaries.
08:59 But I'm also happy
and honored to be up here
09:02 and I think that it's great
that I got to come
09:05 before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed
and I'd had more agency in my career,
09:08 because maybe then I wouldn't tell
the story of how I got my first job,
09:12 or maybe I wouldn't tell the story
of how I paid for college,
09:15 which seems so important right now.
09:17 If there's a takeaway to this talk,
09:19 I hope it's that we all feel
more comfortable acknowledging
09:23 the power of image
in our perceived successes
09:27 and our perceived failures.
09:29 Thank you.
09:30 (Applause)
