00:18 When I was a kid,
00:19 the disaster we worried about most 
was a nuclear war.
00:24 That's why we had a barrel like this
down in our basement,
00:27 filled with cans of food and water.
00:30 When the nuclear attack came,
00:32 we were supposed to go downstairs,
hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.
00:38 Today the greatest risk 
of global catastrophe
00:42 doesn't look like this.
00:44 Instead, it looks like this.
00:48 If anything kills over 10 million people
in the next few decades,
00:54 it's most likely to be 
a highly infectious virus
00:57 rather than a war.
00:60 Not missiles, but microbes.
01:04 Now, part of the reason for this is that
01:06 we've invested a huge amount
in nuclear deterrents.
01:10 But we've actually invested very little 
in a system to stop an epidemic.
01:16 We're not ready for the next epidemic.
01:20 Let's look at Ebola.
01:22 I'm sure all of you read about it 
in the newspaper,
01:26 lots of tough challenges.
01:27 I followed it carefully 
through the case analysis tools
01:31 we use to track polio eradication.
01:36 And as you look at what went on,
01:38 the problem wasn't that there was a system
that didn't work well enough,
01:42 the problem was that we 
didn't have a system at all.
01:47 In fact, there's some pretty obvious
key missing pieces.
01:51 We didn't have a group of epidemiologists 
ready to go, who would have gone,
01:56 seen what the disease was,
seen how far it had spread.
01:60 The case reports came in on paper.
02:02 It was very delayed
before they were put online
02:05 and they were extremely inaccurate.
02:07 We didn't have a medical team ready to go.
02:10 We didn't have a way of preparing people.
02:12 Now, Médecins Sans Frontières 
did a great job orchestrating volunteers.
02:18 But even so, we were far slower
than we should have been
02:21 getting the thousands of workers
into these countries.
02:24 And a large epidemic would require us
to have hundreds of thousands of workers.
02:33 There was no one there 
to look at treatment approaches.
02:37 No one to look at the diagnostics.
02:39 No one to figure out 
what tools should be used.
02:42 As an example, we could have 
taken the blood of survivors,
02:46 processed it, and put that plasma
back in people to protect them.
02:51 But that was never tried.
02:54 So there was a lot that was missing.
02:56 And these things 
are really a global failure.
03:00 The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics,
but not to do these things I talked about.
03:07 Now, in the movies it's quite different.
03:10 There's a group of handsome
epidemiologists ready to go,
03:15 they move in, they save the day,
but that's just pure Hollywood.
03:22 The failure to prepare 
could allow the next epidemic
03:26 to be dramatically 
more devastating than Ebola
03:31 Let's look at the progression 
of Ebola over this year.
03:36 About 10,000 people died,
03:39 and nearly all were in the three
West African countries.
03:44 There's three reasons why
it didn't spread more.
03:46 The first is that there was a lot 
of heroic work by the health workers.
03:51 They found the people and they 
prevented more infections.
03:54 The second is the nature of the virus.
03:57 Ebola does not spread through the air.
03:60 And by the time you're contagious,
04:02 most people are so sick 
that they're bedridden.
04:06 Third, it didn't get
into many urban areas.
04:10 And that was just luck.
04:12 If it had gotten into a lot 
more urban areas,
04:14 the case numbers 
would have been much larger.
04:18 So next time, we might not be so lucky.
04:21 You can have a virus where people 
feel well enough while they're infectious
04:27 that they get on a plane
or they go to a market.
04:30 The source of the virus could be 
a natural epidemic like Ebola,
04:33 or it could be bioterrorism.
04:35 So there are things that would literally
make things a thousand times worse.
04:39 In fact, let's look at a model
of a virus spread through the air,
04:45 like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.
04:50 So here's what would happen:
04:52 It would spread throughout the world
very, very quickly.
04:56 And you can see over 30 million people
died from that epidemic.
05:01 So this is a serious problem.
05:02 We should be concerned.
05:04 But in fact, we can build
a really good response system.
05:09 We have the benefits of all the science
and technology that we talk about here.
05:14 We've got cell phones
05:15 to get information from the public 
and get information out to them.
05:18 We have satellite maps where we can see
where people are and where they're moving.
05:22 We have advances in biology
05:25 that should dramatically change 
the turnaround time to look at a pathogen
05:28 and be able to make drugs and vaccines
that fit for that pathogen.
05:33 So we can have tools,
05:35 but those tools need to be put
into an overall global health system.
05:40 And we need preparedness.
05:42 The best lessons, I think, 
on how to get prepared
05:44 are again, what we do for war.
05:47 For soldiers, we have full-time,
waiting to go.
05:51 We have reserves that can scale 
us up to large numbers.
05:54 NATO has a mobile unit 
that can deploy very rapidly.
05:58 NATO does a lot of war games 
to check, are people well trained?
06:01 Do they understand 
about fuel and logistics
06:04 and the same radio frequencies?
06:06 So they are absolutely ready to go.
06:09 So those are the kinds of things
we need to deal with an epidemic.
06:13 What are the key pieces?
06:15 First, we need strong health systems
in poor countries.
06:21 That's where mothers 
can give birth safely,
06:24 kids can get all their vaccines.
06:25 But, also where we'll see 
the outbreak very early on.
06:30 We need a medical reserve corps:
06:32 lots of people who've got 
the training and background
06:35 who are ready to go, with the expertise.
06:38 And then we need to pair those
medical people with the military.
06:42 taking advantage of the military's ability
to move fast, do logistics
06:46 and secure areas.
06:48 We need to do simulations,
06:51 germ games, not war games,
so that we see where the holes are.
06:56 The last time a germ game 
was done in the United States
06:59 was back in 2001, 
and it didn't go so well.
07:02 So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.
07:07 Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D
in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.
07:14 There are some big breakthroughs, 
like the Adeno-associated virus,
07:17 that could work very, very quickly.
07:21 Now I don't have an exact budget
for what this would cost,
07:25 but I'm quite sure it's very modest
compared to the potential harm.
07:29 The World Bank estimates that 
if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,
07:34 global wealth will go down
by over three trillion dollars
07:37 and we'd have millions
and millions of deaths.
07:41 These investments 
offer significant benefits
07:44 beyond just being ready for the epidemic.
07:47 The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D,
07:49 those things would reduce 
global health equity
07:52 and make the world more just 
as well as more safe.
07:56 So I think this should absolutely
be a priority.
07:60 There's no need to panic.
08:01 We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti
or go down into the basement.
08:05 But we need to get going,
because time is not on our side.
08:09 In fact, if there's one positive thing
that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,
08:16 it's that it can serve as an early 
warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.
08:21 If we start now, we can be ready 
for the next epidemic.
08:27 Thank you.
