00:01 Thank you very much.
00:02 Well, I would like to start with testicles.
00:09 Men who sleep five hours a night
00:12 have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more.
00:20 In addition, men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night
00:25 will have a level of testosterone
00:28 which is that of someone 10 years their senior.
00:33 So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade
00:37 in terms of that critical aspect of wellness.
00:42 And we see equivalent impairments in female reproductive health
00:46 caused by a lack of sleep.
00:51 This is the best news that I have for you today.
00:56 From this point, it may only get worse.
00:59 Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things
01:02 that happen when you get sleep,
01:04 but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough,
01:08 both for your brain and for your body.
01:11 Let me start with the brain
01:14 and the functions of learning and memory,
01:17 because what we've discovered over the past 10 or so years
01:20 is that you need sleep after learning
01:23 to essentially hit the save button on those new memories
01:26 so that you don't forget.
01:29 But recently, we discovered that you also need sleep before learning
01:34 to actually prepare your brain,
01:38 almost like a dry sponge
01:40 ready to initially soak up new information.
01:43 And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain
01:46 essentially become waterlogged, as it were,
01:49 and you can't absorb new memories.
01:52 So let me show you the data.
01:54 Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis
01:58 that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea.
02:02 So we took a group of individuals
02:05 and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups:
02:08 a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group.
02:12 Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber,
02:16 but the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake
02:19 in the laboratory, under full supervision.
02:22 There's no naps or caffeine, by the way, so it's miserable for everyone involved.
02:27 And then the next day,
02:28 we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner
02:32 and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts
02:36 as we're taking snapshots of brain activity.
02:40 And then we're going to test them
02:42 to see how effective that learning has been.
02:45 And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis.
02:48 And when you put those two groups head to head,
02:51 what you find is a quite significant, 40-percent deficit
02:56 in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep.
03:01 I think this should be concerning,
03:03 considering what we know is happening to sleep
03:05 in our education populations right now.
03:09 In fact, to put that in context,
03:10 it would be the difference in a child acing an exam
03:14 versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent.
03:18 And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain
03:22 to produce these types of learning disabilities.
03:27 And there's a structure that sits
03:28 on the left and the right side of your brain, called the hippocampus.
03:33 And you can think of the hippocampus
03:35 almost like the informational inbox of your brain.
03:39 It's very good at receiving new memory files
03:42 and then holding on to them.
03:45 And when you look at this structure
03:47 in those people who'd had a full night of sleep,
03:50 we saw lots of healthy learning-related activity.
03:55 Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived,
03:58 we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever.
04:03 So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox,
04:08 and any new incoming files -- they were just being bounced.
04:12 You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory.
04:18 So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you,
04:23 but let me just come back to that control group for a second.
04:26 Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep?
04:30 Well, we can ask a very different question:
04:33 What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep
04:37 when you do get it
04:38 that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability
04:42 each and every day?
04:44 And by placing electrodes all over the head,
04:47 what we've discovered is that there are big, powerful brainwaves
04:51 that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep
04:55 that have riding on top of them
04:57 these spectacular bursts of electrical activity
05:00 that we call sleep spindles.
05:03 And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves
05:07 that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night,
05:12 shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir
05:16 to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain,
05:20 and therefore protecting them, making them safe.
05:25 And it is important that we understand
05:28 what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits,
05:33 because there are real medical and societal implications.
05:37 And let me just tell you about one area
05:39 that we've moved this work out into, clinically,
05:42 which is the context of aging and dementia.
05:47 Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older,
05:50 our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline.
05:55 But what we've also discovered
05:57 is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse,
06:03 especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing.
06:09 And only last year, we finally published evidence
06:12 that these two things, they're not simply co-occurring,
06:15 they are significantly interrelated.
06:19 And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep
06:22 is an underappreciated factor
06:24 that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline
06:28 in aging, and most recently we've discovered,
06:32 in Alzheimer's disease as well.
06:36 Now, I know this is remarkably depressing news.
06:40 It's in the mail. It's coming at you.
06:42 But there's a potential silver lining here.
06:46 Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging,
06:51 for example changes in the physical structure of the brain,
06:54 that's fiendishly difficult to treat.
06:57 But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle
07:02 of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting
07:05 because we may be able to do something about it.
07:09 And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center
07:12 is not by using sleeping pills, by the way.
07:15 Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep.
07:22 Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this.
07:25 It's called direct current brain stimulation.
07:28 You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain,
07:31 so small you typically don't feel it,
07:34 but it has a measurable impact.
07:37 Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young, healthy adults,
07:43 as if you're sort of singing in time with those deep-sleep brainwaves,
07:48 not only can you amplify the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves,
07:52 but in doing so, we can almost double the amount of memory benefit
07:57 that you get from sleep.
07:59 The question now is whether we can translate
08:02 this same affordable, potentially portable piece of technology
08:06 into older adults and those with dementia.
08:11 Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep,
08:15 and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning
08:20 and memory function?
08:21 That is my real hope now.
08:24 That's one of our moon-shot goals, as it were.
08:29 So that's an example of sleep for your brain,
08:33 but sleep is just as essential for your body.
08:37 We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system.
08:42 Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system,
08:47 and that all it takes is one hour.
08:50 Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people
08:55 across 70 countries twice a year,
08:60 and it's called daylight saving time.
09:03 Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep,
09:06 we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day.
09:15 In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep,
09:18 we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks.
09:24 Isn't that incredible?
09:27 And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents,
09:33 even suicide rates.
09:37 But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this:
09:40 sleep loss and your immune system.
09:43 And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image.
09:48 They are called natural killer cells,
09:51 and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents
09:56 of your immune system.
09:58 They are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements
10:03 and eliminating them.
10:05 In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.
10:11 So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins
10:17 at all times,
10:19 and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough.
10:24 So here in this experiment,
10:25 you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night,
10:29 you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours
10:33 for one single night,
10:35 and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction
10:38 in immune cell activity that you suffer.
10:41 And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent,
10:44 it's not 20 percent.
10:46 There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity.
10:52 That's a concerning state of immune deficiency,
10:57 and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding
11:00 significant links between short sleep duration
11:04 and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer.
11:10 Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel,
11:13 cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast.
11:18 In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong
11:23 that the World Health Organization
11:26 has classified any form of nighttime shift work
11:30 as a probable carcinogen,
11:33 because of a disruption of your sleep-wake rhythms.
11:38 So you may have heard of that old maxim
11:41 that you can sleep when you're dead.
11:43 Well, I'm being quite serious now --
11:45 it is mortally unwise advice.
11:48 We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals.
11:53 There's a simple truth:
11:55 the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.
11:59 Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.
12:05 And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer
12:09 or even Alzheimer's disease
12:11 were not sufficiently disquieting,
12:16 we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode
12:19 the very fabric of biological life itself,
12:25 your DNA genetic code.
12:28 So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults
12:32 and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night
12:36 for one week,
12:37 and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile
12:41 relative to when those same individuals
12:44 were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night.
12:47 And there were two critical findings.
12:50 First, a sizable and significant 711 genes
12:55 were distorted in their activity,
12:58 caused by a lack of sleep.
12:60 The second result was that about half of those genes
13:03 were actually increased in their activity.
13:06 The other half were decreased.
13:08 Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep
13:12 were genes associated with your immune system,
13:15 so once again, you can see that immune deficiency.
13:19 In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated
13:22 or increased by way of a lack of sleep,
13:25 were genes associated with the promotion of tumors,
13:29 genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body,
13:34 and genes associated with stress,
13:37 and, as a consequence, cardiovascular disease.
13:41 There is simply no aspect of your wellness
13:45 that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation
13:48 and get away unscathed.
13:51 It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home.
13:54 Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny
13:58 of your physiology,
14:00 even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet
14:04 that spells out your daily health narrative.
14:10 And at this point, you may be thinking,
14:13 "Oh my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep?
14:15 What are you tips for good sleep?"
14:18 Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact
14:23 of alcohol and caffeine on sleep,
14:26 and if you're struggling with sleep at night,
14:28 avoiding naps during the day,
14:30 I have two pieces of advice for you.
14:33 The first is regularity.
14:36 Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time,
14:39 no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend.
14:42 Regularity is king,
14:45 and it will anchor your sleep
14:47 and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep.
14:52 The second is keep it cool.
14:56 Your body needs to drop its core temperature
14:59 by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep
15:03 and then to stay asleep,
15:05 and it's the reason you will always find it easier
15:07 to fall asleep in a room that's too cold
15:10 than too hot.
15:12 So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees,
15:16 or about 18 degrees Celsius.
15:18 That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people.
15:22 And then finally, in taking a step back, then,
15:26 what is the mission-critical statement here?
15:31 Well, I think it may be this:
15:33 sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury.
15:39 Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity.
15:45 It is your life-support system,
15:48 and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality.
15:55 And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations
15:59 is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness,
16:04 even the safety and the education of our children.
16:08 It's a silent sleep loss epidemic,
16:11 and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges
16:15 that we face in the 21st century.
16:20 I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right
16:25 to a full night of sleep,
16:28 and without embarrassment
16:30 or that unfortunate stigma of laziness.
16:35 And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life,
16:42 the Swiss Army knife of health, as it were.
16:47 And with that soapbox rant over,
16:49 I will simply say, good night, good luck,
16:51 and above all ...
16:55 I do hope you sleep well.
16:57 Thank you very much indeed.
17:08 David Biello: No, no, no. Stay there for a second.
17:11 Good job not running away, though. I appreciate that.
17:14 So that was terrifying.
17:15 Matt Walker: You're welcome. DB: Yes, thank you, thank you.
17:18 Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do?
17:23 What do we do when we're, like, tossing and turning in bed late at night
17:27 or doing shift work or whatever else?
17:30 MW: So you're right, we can't catch up on sleep.
17:33 Sleep is not like the bank.
17:34 You can't accumulate a debt
17:36 and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time.
17:39 I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic
17:42 and that our health deteriorates so quickly,
17:45 first, it's because human beings are the only species
17:48 that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason.
17:53 DB: Because we're smart.
17:54 MW: And I make that point sbecause it means that Mother Nature,
17:59 throughout the course of evolution,
18:00 has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation.
18:05 So she's never developed a safety net,
18:09 and that's why when you undersleep,
18:11 things just sort of implode so quickly, both within the brain and the body.
18:15 So you just have to prioritize.
18:18 DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed,
18:21 what do I do?
18:23 MW: So if you are staying in bed awake for too long,
18:27 you should get out of bed and go to a different room
18:31 and do something different.
18:32 The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom
18:36 with the place of wakefulness,
18:39 and you need to break that association.
18:41 So only return to bed when you are sleepy,
18:44 and that way you will relearn the association that you once had,
18:48 which is your bed is the place of sleep.
18:50 So the analogy would be,
18:52 you'd never sit at the dinner table, waiting to get hungry,
18:56 so why would you lie in bed, waiting to get sleepy?
18:60 DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call.
19:02 Great job, Matt.
19:03 MW: You're very welcome.
